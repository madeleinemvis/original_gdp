Depopulation Through Forced Vaccination:
The Zero Carbon Solution
By Rachel Windeer. (First published June 2011)
On April 26th, 2009 the Irish Independent published an article titled ‘Concern for Children’s Health as Parents ignoring vaccines’. Edel Kennedy, you should be ashamed of yourself! This is nothing less than an attempt by government, through their puppets in the media, to remove the rights of parents to determine the life choices of their offspring and removes any doubt that we now live in a dictatorship.
This is an OUTRAGEOUS insult to every parent in the country who has the common sense to research the efficacy of vaccines themselves by simply looking at the historical record rather than trust politicians whose lies
in the media, including those perpetrated by the Dept. of Health under Mary Harney regarding the farce of ‘ swine flu’ and the dangerous myth of HPV vaccination, have led the country into the abyss of utter poverty
and sold the country into the communist grasp of European bureaucrats whose sole aim is the destruction of every member nation’s sovereignty leaving them clutching at the bailout begging bowl of the IMF.
Vaccines are a fraud; pure and simple!
The historical record PROVES this for anyone with a little patience and the courage to investigate the FACTS for themselves, and it does take courage, especially for those in the medical profession whose careers will be at risk if they dare expose this danger to our children. It also shatters their illusions that they’re part of an organization which is far from beneficial to those they believe they’ re protecting from illness. However, their Hypocratic Oath should compel them to investigate such wild claims put out by pharmaceutical giants and their drug dealer sales representatives instead of taking the word of an industry well known as being utterly corrupt and ruthless in its business practices.
The Irish haemophiliac scandal, where patients were knowingly infected with HIV through contaminated blood
products should be enough to convince anyone of Big Pharma’s murderous intent. This brings us to the real reasons for vaccinations. I’m not even going to prove to readers that they don’t work. I’ll simply urge you to look up the historical record. One simple example is the demise of measles.
The measles death rate had declined by 98% from 1915-1958 prior to any vaccination being introduced.
In 1988 and 1989, 69% and 89% for measles cases in American school-aged children had been vaccinated.
In 1995, 56% of ALL measles cases in America were vaccinated.
These figures come from medical journals. Those 3 simple examples PROVE that unvaccinated children are less likely to contract measles and that the vaccine was useless. Look that up for yourself. All other vaccine claims that they’ve cured or eliminated disease follow a similar pattern. Better hygiene, clean water and good healthy food was the cause of the decline and any doctor worth his smelling salts should know that. If they don’t then they are misinformed on a grand scale or they’re in complete denial. Therein lies the problem. Why have doctors been ‘indoctrinated’ to believe that vaccines are the sacred cow of medicine when the historical record clearly shows that they are virtually useless?
Hold onto your sanity because I have some bad news for you.
The real reason for vaccinations, apart from the massive profits to the manufacturers, is to ensure that you get sick throughout your life, again not only to enrich these same corporations that made you sick, but to ensure that many, if not all of you, die before you ever receive your pension and when you are no longer any of use to society. That’s why they want you retiring later in life and are forcing you through economic terrorism to work longer regardless of your age or health. They literally want to work you to death. If you don’t work you will be classed as a burden to society, a financial cost which society has to bear, and therefore you will be stigmatised as a ‘useless eater’; a consumer of resources needed for the rest of society. When Big Pharma can no longer profit from the illness they gave you, you will be left to die.
This is the depopulation agenda promoted under the United Nations Division of Population under the Department of Economic and Social Affairs. We only need look at Africa, the nation which the United Nations has said themselves, could feed the world. Why then are millions in Africa starving to death on that continent? It’s meant to be that way folks.
All of us at one time or another have been led to believe in the efficacy of vaccines. I was one of them and had
my child vaccinated nearly 35 years ago. I wouldn’t even dream of it now. I think it’s safe to say that we’re all aware of the real pandemic, as opposed to the fake pandemics of the past. It’s called ‘CANCER’. Autism is also at crisis (pandemic) levels all across the world where mass vaccination programs exist.
Prior to mass vaccination, cancers were extremely rare, as in almost nonexistent. Today in the western, so called developed world, we face a crisis of cancer to the extent that between one in five to one in two will suffer, many dying, from one form of cancer or another. What’s happened to cause this pandemic?
We only have to look back at the Jonas Salk polio vaccine that went around the world in the full knowledge that it contained the SV40 virus which had no other purpose than causing cancer; yet it was pushed as a vaccine for polio when, as with measles, polio was well in decline prior to any vaccine due to the same factors.
Enter stage right at the TED 201 0 conference, Mr. Bill Gates, head of Microsoft, the biggest computer firm on the planet. What has Bill Gates to do with vaccines you’ re wondering?
See the quote in the image above. Those are his EXACT words. Are you beginning to get the picture?
The globalist elite care nothing for humanity; ordinary men, women and children must be eliminated in their
delusional minds to ensure that their superior types go into the future with the best of breeding being the only criteria worthy of saving. You and I are no longer required and that is why we are seeing the loss of our
economy, our wealth, our health, our happiness and ultimately, OUR LIVES
(In 2020, look where we are now with Gates still calling the shots!)

Leviathan or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, commonly referred to as Leviathan, is a book written by Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) and published in 1651 (revised Latin edition 1668).[1][4][5] Its name derives from the biblical Leviathan. The work concerns the structure of society and legitimate government, and is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of social contract theory.[6] Written during the English Civil War (1642–1651), it argues for a social contract and rule by an absolute sovereign. Hobbes wrote that civil war and the brute situation of a state of nature (""the war of all against all"") could be avoided only by strong, undivided government.
Content[edit]
Title[edit]
The title of Hobbes's treatise alludes to the Leviathan mentioned in the Book of Job. In contrast to the simply informative titles usually given to works of early modern political philosophy, such as John Locke's Two Treatises of Government or Hobbes's own earlier work The Elements of Law, Hobbes selected a more poetic name for this more provocative treatise. Lexicographers in the early modern period believed that the term ""leviathan"" was associated with the Hebrew words lavah, meaning ""to couple, connect, or join"", and thannin, meaning ""a serpent or dragon"".[7] In the Westminster Assembly's annotations on the Bible, the interpreters believed that the creature was named using these root words ""because by his bignesse he seemes not one single creature, but a coupling of divers together; or because his scales are closed, or straitly compacted together.""[8] Samuel Mintz suggests that these connotations lend themselves to Hobbes's understanding of political force since both ""Leviathan and Hobbes's sovereign are unities compacted out of separate individuals; they are omnipotent; they cannot be destroyed or divided; they inspire fear in men; they do not make pacts with men; theirs is the dominion of power"" on pain of death.[9]
Frontispiece[edit]
After lengthy discussion with Thomas Hobbes, the Parisian Abraham Bosse created the etching for the book's famous frontispiece in the géometrique style which Bosse himself had refined. It is similar in organisation to the frontispiece of Hobbes' De Cive (1642), created by Jean Matheus. The frontispiece has two main elements, of which the upper part is by far the more striking.
In it, a giant crowned figure is seen emerging from the landscape, clutching a sword and a crosier, beneath a quote from the Book of Job—""Non est potestas Super Terram quae Comparetur ei. Iob. 41 . 24"" (""There is no power on earth to be compared to him. Job 41 . 24"")—further linking the figure to the monster of that book. (Due to disagreements over the precise location of the chapters and verses when they were divided in the Late Middle Ages, the verse Hobbes quotes is usually given as Job 41:33 in modern Christian translations into English, Job 41:25 in the Masoretic text, Septuagint, and the Luther Bible; it is Job 41:24 in the Vulgate.) The torso and arms of the figure are composed of over three hundred persons, in the style of Giuseppe Arcimboldo; all are facing away from the viewer, with just the giant's head having visible facial features. (A manuscript of Leviathan created for Charles II in 1651 has notable differences – a different main head but significantly the body is also composed of many faces, all looking outwards from the body and with a range of expressions.)
The lower portion is a triptych, framed in a wooden border. The centre form contains the title on an ornate curtain. The two sides reflect the sword and crosier of the main figure – earthly power on the left and the powers of the church on the right. Each side element reflects the equivalent power – castle to church, crown to mitre, cannon to excommunication, weapons to logic, and the battlefield to the religious courts. The giant holds the symbols of both sides, reflecting the union of secular, and spiritual in the sovereign, but the construction of the torso also makes the figure the state.
Part I: Of Man[edit]
Hobbes begins his treatise on politics with an account of human nature. He presents an image of man as matter in motion, attempting to show through example how everything about humanity can be explained materialistically, that is, without recourse to an incorporeal, immaterial soul or a faculty for understanding ideas that are external to the human mind. Hobbes proceeds by defining terms clearly and unsentimentally. Good and evil are nothing more than terms used to denote an individual's appetites and desires, while these appetites and desires are nothing more than the tendency to move toward or away from an object. Hope is nothing more than an appetite for a thing combined with an opinion that it can be had. He suggests that the dominant political theology of the time, Scholasticism, thrives on confused definitions of everyday words, such as incorporeal substance, which for Hobbes is a contradiction in terms.
Hobbes describes human psychology without any reference to the summum bonum, or greatest good, as previous thought had done. Not only is the concept of a summum bonum superfluous, but given the variability of human desires, there could be no such thing. Consequently, any political community that sought to provide the greatest good to its members would find itself driven by competing conceptions of that good with no way to decide among them. The result would be civil war.
However, Hobbes states that there is a summum malum, or greatest evil. This is the fear of violent death. A political community can be oriented around this fear.
Since there is no summum bonum, the natural state of man is not to be found in a political community that pursues the greatest good. But to be outside of a political community is to be in an anarchic condition. Given human nature, the variability of human desires, and need for scarce resources to fulfill those desires, the state of nature, as Hobbes calls this anarchic condition, must be a war of all against all. Even when two men are not fighting, there is no guarantee that the other will not try to kill him for his property or just out of an aggrieved sense of honour, and so they must constantly be on guard against one another. It is even reasonable to preemptively attack one's neighbour.
In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation nor the use of commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.[10]
The desire to avoid the state of nature, as the place where the summum malum of violent death is most likely to occur, forms the polestar of political reasoning. It suggests a number of laws of nature, although Hobbes is quick to point out that they cannot properly speaking be called ""laws,"" since there is no one to enforce them. The first thing that reason suggests is to seek peace, but that where peace cannot be had, to use all of the advantages of war.[11] Hobbes is explicit that in the state of nature nothing can be considered just or unjust, and every man must be considered to have a right to all things.[12] The second law of nature is that one ought to be willing to renounce one's right to all things where others are willing to do the same, to quit the state of nature, and to erect a commonwealth with the authority to command them in all things. Hobbes concludes Part One by articulating an additional seventeen laws of nature that make the performance of the first two possible and by explaining what it would mean for a sovereign to represent the people even when they disagree with the sovereign.
Part II: Of Commonwealth[edit]
The purpose of a commonwealth is given at the start of Part II:
THE final cause, end, or design of men (who naturally love liberty, and dominion over others) in the introduction of that restraint upon themselves, in which we see them live in Commonwealths, is the foresight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life thereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that miserable condition of war which is necessarily consequent, as hath been shown, to the natural passions of men when there is no visible power to keep them in awe, and tie them by fear of punishment to the performance of their covenants...
The commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.
The sovereign has twelve principal rights:[13]
- Because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) change the form of government.
- Because the covenant forming the commonwealth results from subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them, the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.
- The sovereign exists because the majority has consented to his rule; the minority have agreed to abide by this arrangement and must then assent to the sovereign's actions.
- Every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his subjects and cannot be accused of injustice.
- Following this, the sovereign cannot justly be put to death by the subjects.
- Because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord. Therefore, the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse, who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes, and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.
- To prescribe the rules of civil law and property.
- To be judge in all cases.
- To make war and peace as he sees fit and to command the army.
- To choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.
- To reward with riches and honour or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or ignominy.
- To establish laws about honour and a scale of worth.
Hobbes explicitly rejects the idea of Separation of Powers. In item 6 Hobbes is explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech should they be considered desirable by the sovereign to promote order.
Types[edit]
There are three (monarchy, aristocracy and democracy):
The difference of Commonwealths consisted in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy.
And only three; since unlike Aristotle he does not sub-divide them into ""good"" and ""deviant"":
Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire. There be other names of government in the histories and books of policy; as tyranny and oligarchy; but they are not the names of other forms of government, but of the same forms misliked. For they that are discontented under monarchy call it tyranny; and they that are displeased with aristocracy call it oligarchy: so also, they which find themselves grieved under a democracy call it anarchy, which signifies want of government; and yet I think no man believes that want of government is any new kind of government: nor by the same reason ought they to believe that the government is of one kind when they like it, and another when they mislike it or are oppressed by the governors.
And monarchy is the best, on practical grounds:
The difference between these three kinds of Commonwealth consisteth not in the difference of power, but in the difference of convenience or aptitude to produce the peace and security of the people; for which end they were instituted. And to compare monarchy with the other two, we may observe: first, that whosoever beareth the person of the people, or is one of that assembly that bears it, beareth also his own natural person. And though he be careful in his politic person to procure the common interest, yet he is more, or no less, careful to procure the private good of himself, his family, kindred and friends; and for the most part, if the public interest chance to cross the private, he prefers the private: for the passions of men are commonly more potent than their reason. From whence it follows that where the public and private interest are most closely united, there is the public most advanced. Now in monarchy the private interest is the same with the public. The riches, power, and honour of a monarch arise only from the riches, strength, and reputation of his subjects. For no king can be rich, nor glorious, nor secure, whose subjects are either poor, or contemptible, or too weak through want, or dissension, to maintain a war against their enemies; whereas in a democracy, or aristocracy, the public prosperity confers not so much to the private fortune of one that is corrupt, or ambitious, as doth many times a perfidious advice, a treacherous action, or a civil war.
Succession[edit]
The right of succession always lies with the sovereign. Democracies and aristocracies have easy succession; monarchy is harder:
The greatest difficulty about the right of succession is in monarchy: and the difficulty ariseth from this, that at first sight, it is not manifest who is to appoint the successor; nor many times who it is whom he hath appointed. For in both these cases, there is required a more exact ratiocination than every man is accustomed to use.
Because in general people haven't thought carefully. However, the succession is definitely in the gift of the monarch:
As to the question who shall appoint the successor of a monarch that hath the sovereign authority... we are to consider that either he that is in possession has right to dispose of the succession, or else that right is again in the dissolved multitude. ... Therefore it is manifest that by the institution of monarchy, the disposing of the successor is always left to the judgement and will of the present possessor.
But, it is not always obvious who the monarch has appointed:
And for the question which may arise sometimes, who it is that the monarch in possession hath designed to the succession and inheritance of his power
However, the answer is:
it is determined by his express words and testament; or by other tacit signs sufficient.
And this means:
By express words, or testament, when it is declared by him in his lifetime, viva voce, or by writing; as the first emperors of Rome declared who should be their heirs.
Note that (perhaps rather radically) this does not have to be any blood relative:
For the word heir does not of itself imply the children or nearest kindred of a man; but whomsoever a man shall any way declare he would have to succeed him in his estate. If therefore a monarch declare expressly that such a man shall be his heir, either by word or writing, then is that man immediately after the decease of his predecessor invested in the right of being monarch.
However, practically this means:
But where testament and express words are wanting, other natural signs of the will are to be followed: whereof the one is custom. And therefore where the custom is that the next of kindred absolutely succeedeth, there also the next of kindred hath right to the succession; for that, if the will of him that was in possession had been otherwise, he might easily have declared the same in his lifetime...
Religion[edit]
In Leviathan, Hobbes explicitly states that the sovereign has authority to assert power over matters of faith and doctrine and that if he does not do so, he invites discord. Hobbes presents his own religious theory but states that he would defer to the will of the sovereign (when that was re-established: again, Leviathan was written during the Civil War) as to whether his theory was acceptable. Hobbes' materialistic presuppositions also led him to hold a view which was considered highly controversial at the time. Hobbes rejected the idea of incorporeal substances and subsequently argued that even God himself was a corporeal substance. Although Hobbes never explicitly stated he was an atheist, many allude to the possibility that he is.
Taxation[edit]
Hobbes also touched upon the sovereign's ability to tax in Leviathan, although he is not as widely cited for his economic theories as he is for his political theories.[14] Hobbes believed that equal justice includes the equal imposition of taxes. The equality of taxes doesn't depend on equality of wealth, but on the equality of the debt that every man owes to the commonwealth for his defence and the maintenance of the rule of law.[15] Hobbes also championed public support for those unable to maintain themselves by labour, which would presumably be funded by taxation. He advocated public encouragement of works of Navigation etc. to usefully employ the poor who could work.
Part III: Of a Christian Commonwealth[edit]
In Part III Hobbes seeks to investigate the nature of a Christian commonwealth. This immediately raises the question of which scriptures we should trust, and why. If any person may claim supernatural revelation superior to the civil law, then there would be chaos, and Hobbes' fervent desire is to avoid this. Hobbes thus begins by establishing that we cannot infallibly know another's personal word to be divine revelation:
When God speaketh to man, it must be either immediately or by mediation of another man, to whom He had formerly spoken by Himself immediately. How God speaketh to a man immediately may be understood by those well enough to whom He hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood by another is hard, if not impossible, to know. For if a man pretend to me that God hath spoken to him supernaturally, and immediately, and I make doubt of it, I cannot easily perceive what argument he can produce to oblige me to believe it.
This is good, but if applied too fervently would lead to all the Bible being rejected. So, Hobbes says, we need a test: and the true test is established by examining the books of scripture, and is:
So that it is manifest that the teaching of the religion which God hath established, and the showing of a present miracle, joined together, were the only marks whereby the Scripture would have a true prophet, that is to say, immediate revelation, to be acknowledged; of them being singly sufficient to oblige any other man to regard what he saith.
Seeing therefore miracles now cease, we have no sign left whereby to acknowledge the pretended revelations or inspirations of any private man; nor obligation to give ear to any doctrine, farther than it is conformable to the Holy Scriptures, which since the time of our Saviour supply the place and sufficiently recompense the want of all other prophecy
""Seeing therefore miracles now cease"" means that only the books of the Bible can be trusted. Hobbes then discusses the various books which are accepted by various sects, and the ""question much disputed between the diverse sects of Christian religion, from whence the Scriptures derive their authority"". To Hobbes, ""it is manifest that none can know they are God's word (though all true Christians believe it) but those to whom God Himself hath revealed it supernaturally"". And therefore ""The question truly stated is: by what authority they are made law?""
Unsurprisingly, Hobbes concludes that ultimately there is no way to determine this other than the civil power:
He therefore to whom God hath not supernaturally revealed that they are His, nor that those that published them were sent by Him, is not obliged to obey them by any authority but his whose commands have already the force of laws; that is to say, by any other authority than that of the Commonwealth, residing in the sovereign, who only has the legislative power.
He discusses the Ten Commandments, and asks ""who it was that gave to these written tables the obligatory force of laws. There is no doubt but they were made laws by God Himself: but because a law obliges not, nor is law to any but to them that acknowledge it to be the act of the sovereign, how could the people of Israel, that were forbidden to approach the mountain to hear what God said to Moses, be obliged to obedience to all those laws which Moses propounded to them?"" and concludes, as before, that ""making of the Scripture law, belonged to the civil sovereign.""
Finally: ""We are to consider now what office in the Church those persons have who, being civil sovereigns, have embraced also the Christian faith?"" to which the answer is: ""Christian kings are still the supreme pastors of their people, and have power to ordain what pastors they please, to teach the Church, that is, to teach the people committed to their charge.""
There is an enormous amount of biblical scholarship in this third part. However, once Hobbes' initial argument is accepted (that no-one can know for sure anyone else's divine revelation) his conclusion (the religious power is subordinate to the civil) follows from his logic. The very extensive discussions of the chapter were probably necessary for its time. The need (as Hobbes saw it) for the civil sovereign to be supreme arose partly from the many sects that arose around the civil war, and to quash the Pope of Rome's challenge, to which Hobbes devotes an extensive section.
Part IV: Of the Kingdom of Darkness[edit]
Hobbes named Part IV of his book Kingdom of Darkness. By this, Hobbes does not mean Hell (he did not believe in Hell or Purgatory)[16] but the darkness of ignorance as opposed to the light of true knowledge. Hobbes' interpretation is largely unorthodox and so sees much darkness in what he sees as the misinterpretation of Scripture.
- This considered, the kingdom of darkness... is nothing else but a confederacy of deceivers that, to obtain dominion over men in this present world, endeavour, by dark and erroneous doctrines, to extinguish in them the light...[17]
Hobbes enumerates four causes of this darkness.
The first is by extinguishing the light of scripture through misinterpretation. Hobbes sees the main abuse as teaching that the kingdom of God can be found in the church, thus undermining the authority of the civil sovereign. Another general abuse of scripture, in his view, is the turning of consecration into conjuration, or silly ritual.
The second cause is the demonology of the heathen poets: in Hobbes's opinion, demons are nothing more than constructs of the brain. Hobbes then goes on to criticize what he sees as many of the practices of Catholicism: ""Now for the worship of saints, and images, and relics, and other things at this day practiced in the Church of Rome, I say they are not allowed by the word of God"".
The third is by mixing with the Scripture diverse relics of the religion, and much of the vain and erroneous philosophy of the Greeks, especially of Aristotle. Hobbes has little time for the various disputing sects of philosophers and objects to what people have taken ""From Aristotle's civil philosophy, they have learned to call all manner of Commonwealths but the popular (such as was at that time the state of Athens), tyranny"". At the end of this comes an interesting section (darkness is suppressing true knowledge as well as introducing falsehoods), which would appear to bear on the discoveries of Galileo Galilei. ""Our own navigations make manifest, and all men learned in human sciences now acknowledge, there are antipodes"" (i.e., the Earth is round) ""...Nevertheless, men... have been punished for it by authority ecclesiastical. But what reason is there for it? Is it because such opinions are contrary to true religion? That cannot be, if they be true."" However, Hobbes is quite happy for the truth to be suppressed if necessary: if ""they tend to disorder in government, as countenancing rebellion or sedition? Then let them be silenced, and the teachers punished"" – but only by the civil authority.
The fourth is by mingling with both these, false or uncertain traditions, and feigned or uncertain history.
Hobbes finishes by inquiring who benefits from the errors he diagnoses:
- Cicero maketh honourable mention of one of the Cassii, a severe judge amongst the Romans, for a custom he had in criminal causes, when the testimony of the witnesses was not sufficient, to ask the accusers, cui bono; that is to say, what profit, honour, or other contentment the accused obtained or expected by the fact. For amongst presumptions, there is none that so evidently declareth the author as doth the benefit of the action.
Hobbes concludes that the beneficiaries are the churches and churchmen.

3,"10 December 2020 ESMA70-151-995 1 ARTICLE 49(1) of CSDR Key relevant provisions of national corporate or similar law Article 49 (Freedom to issue in a CSD authorised in the Union) of Regulation (EU) No 909/20141 (CSDR) provides that: “1. An issuer shall have the right to arrange for its securities admitted to trading on regulated markets or MTFs or traded on trading venues to be recorded in any CSD established in any Member State, subject to compliance by that CSD with conditions referred to in Article 23. Without prejudice to the issuer’s right referred to in the first subparagraph, the corporate or similar law of the Member State under which the securities are constituted shall continue to apply. Member States shall ensure that a list of key relevant provisions of their law, as referred to in the second subparagraph, is compiled. Competent authorities shall communicate that list to ESMA by 18 December 2014. ESMA shall publish the list by 18 January 2015.” The list below has been aggregated by ESMA based on the information provided by the competent authorities of the Member States in accordance with Article 49(1) of the CSDR. ESMA will update the information regularly based on notifications received from the national competent authorities. Therefore, the competent authorities of the Member States are responsible for the content of this list and ESMA is not able to provide any representation or warranty that the available content is complete, accurate or up to date. The publication of this list of key relevant provisions of Member States’ law does not exonerate financial market participants (in particular issuers of financial instruments and CSDs) from carrying out their own analysis of any relevant law applicable to their situation. In addition to the above, attention is also drawn to the Legal Notice on the ESMA website. 1 Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on improving

(extrait) Les valeurs mobilières sont des titres financiers au sens de l'article L. 211-1 du code monétaire et financier, qui confèrent des droits identiques par catégorie. Les valeurs mobilières émises par les sociétés par actions revêtent la forme de titres au porteur ou de titres nominatifs, sauf pour les sociétés pour lesquelles la loi ou les statuts imposent la seule forme nominative, pour tout ou partie du capital.Ces valeurs mobilières, quelle que soit leur forme, doivent être inscrites en compte au nom de leur propriétaire, dans les conditions prévues aux articles L. 211-3 et L. 211-4 du code monétaire et financier. Toutefois, lorsque des titres de capital ou des obligations de la société ont été admis aux négociations sur un marché réglementé et que leur propriétaire n'a pas son domicile sur le territoire français, au sens de l'article 102 du code civil, tout intermédiaire peut être inscrit pour le compte de ce propriétaire. Cette inscription peut être faite sous la forme d'un compte collectif ou en plusieurs comptes individuels correspondant chacun à un propriétaire. L'intermédiaire inscrit est tenu, au moment de l'ouverture de son compte auprès soit de la société émettrice, soit de l'intermédiaire mentionné à l'article L. 211- 3 du code monétaire et financier qui tient le compte-titres, de déclarer, dans les conditions fixées par décret, sa qualité d'intermédiaire détenant des titres pour le compte d'autrui. En cas de cession de valeurs mobilières admises aux opérations d'un dépositaire securities: common provisions Article L228-1. (abstract) (Internal translation) Transferable securities are financial securities within the meaning of Article L. 211-1 of the French monetary and financial Code, that provide for identical rights per securities type. The transferable securities issued by joint- stock companies take the form of bearer securities or registered securities, with the exception of companies in respect of which the law or the articles of association impose the registered form only for some or all of the capital. Such transferable securities, regardless of their form, must be registered in the name of their holder as provided for in article L. 211-3 and L 211-4 of the French monetary and financial Code. However, if the company's capital securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market and their holder is not domiciled in France within the meaning of Article 102 of the Civil Code, any intermediary may be registered on behalf of that holder. Such registration may be made in the form of a joint account or several individual accounts each corresponding to one holder.

5,"Comprehensive ESG Backed by World’s Largest Sovereign Wealth Fund
March 4, 2020 /3BL Media/ - A report from Norges Bank Investment Management – manager of the one trillion Euro Government Pension Fund of Norway – has called for businesses to improve metrics to ensure they disclose ‘relevant, quantitative and comparable information on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues’.
Norges also set out on Tuesday (March 3) that ESG reporting should ‘use established standards, starting with disclosures based on the GRI Standards’. In addition, they made clear that climate change mitigation reporting should include both direct and indirect carbon emissions disclosures, inclusive of emissions in a company’s value chain.
GRI Chief Executive Tim Mohin said:
“Disclosures based on the GRI Standards offer data that help investors, companies and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. This report from Norges Investment Management reinforces the importance of comprehensive ESG disclosures for investors.
We commend Norges’ call for companies to disclose both direct and indirect carbon emissions. Climate change is a global emergency and, for most companies, the majority of their carbon emissions are indirect. Companies must measure, disclose and manage these impacts if we are to tackle the climate crisis.
For more than 20 years, GRI has enabled reporting on impacts that are material to the environment and society. Focusing solely on the financial implications of the reporting company will not further sustainable development nor will it ultimately serve the long-term interests of investors.”

8,"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System Satoshi Nakamoto satoshin@gmx.com www.bitcoin.org Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. 1. Introduction Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non- reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party. What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. 1 2. Transactions We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank. We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. 3. Timestamp Server The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it. 2 Block Item Item ... Hash Block Item Item ... Hash Transaction Owner 1's Public Key Owner 0's Signature Hash Transaction Owner 2's Public Key Owner 1's Signature Hash Verify Transaction Owner 3's Public Key Owner 2's Signature Hash Verify Owner 2's Private Key Owner 1's Private Key Sig n Sig n Owner 3's Private Key 4. Proof-of-Work To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof- of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it. The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. 5. Network The steps to run the network are as follows: 1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes. 2) Each node collects new transactions into a block. 3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block. 4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. 5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent. 6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash. Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof- of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one. 3 Block Prev Hash Nonce Tx Tx ... Block Prev Hash Nonce Tx Tx ... New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one. 6. Incentive By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended. The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free. The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth. 7. Reclaiming Disk Space Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored. A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory. 4 BlockBlock Block Header (Block Hash) Prev Hash Nonce Hash01 Hash0 Hash1 Hash2 Hash3 Hash23 Root Hash Hash01 Hash2 Tx3 Hash23 Block Header (Block Hash) Root Hash Transactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree After Pruning Tx0-2 from the Block Prev Hash Nonce Hash3 Tx0 Tx1 Tx2 Tx3 8. Simplified Payment Verification It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it. As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification. 9. Combining and Splitting Value Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender. It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history. 5 Transaction In ... In Out ...

Privacy The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were. As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner. 11. Calculations We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent. The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1. The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]: p = probability an honest node finds the next block q = probability the attacker finds the next block qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind q z={ 1 if p≤qq / pz if pq} 6 Identities Transactions Trusted Third Party Counterparty Public Identities Transactions Public New Privacy Model Traditional Privacy Model Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind. We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to himself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the sender hopes it will be too late. The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at that moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction. The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been linked after it. He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value: =z q p To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point: ∑ k=0 ∞ k e− k ! ⋅{q / p z−k  if k≤ z1 if k z} Rearranging to avoid summing the infinite tail of the distribution... 1−∑ k=0 z k e− k ! 1−q / p z−k  Converting to C code... #include <math.h> double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z) { double p = 1.0 - q; double lambda = z * (q / p); double sum = 1.0; int i, k; for (k = 0; k <= z; k++) { double poisson = exp(-lambda); for (i = 1; i <= k; i++) poisson *= lambda / i; sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k)); } return sum; } 7 Running some results, we can see the probability drop off exponentially with z. q=0.1 z=0 P=1.0000000 z=1 P=0.2045873 z=2 P=0.0509779 z=3 P=0.0131722 z=4 P=0.0034552 z=5 P=0.0009137 z=6 P=0.0002428 z=7 P=0.0000647 z=8 P=0.0000173 z=9 P=0.0000046 z=10 P=0.0000012 q=0.3 z=0 P=1.0000000 z=5 P=0.1773523 z=10 P=0.0416605 z=15 P=0.0101008 z=20 P=0.0024804 z=25 P=0.0006132 z=30 P=0.0001522 z=35 P=0.0000379 z=40 P=0.0000095 z=45 P=0.0000024 z=50 P=0.0000006 Solving for P less than 0.1%...

We started with the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism. 8 References [1] W. Dai, ""b-money,"" http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt, 1998. [2] H. Massias, X.S. Avila, and J.-J.

Historically, the Commonwealth was an evolutionary outgrowth of the British Empire. The traditional British policy of allowing considerable self-government in its colonies led to the existence by the 19th century of several dependent states that were populated to a significant degree by Europeans accustomed to forms of parliamentary rule and that possessed large measures of sovereignty. By 1931 they were recognized as having special status within the empire by the Statute of Westminster, which referred specifically to a “British Commonwealth of Nations.” The rapid growth of nationalism in other parts of the empire from the 1920s produced a long series of grants of independence, beginning with that to India in 1947, and required a redefinition of the Commonwealth. In 1947 India and Pakistan became members of the Commonwealth, the first with chiefly non-European populations. In 1948 Burma (Myanmar) became independent and rejected membership. In 1949 India announced its intention to become a republic, which would have required its withdrawal from the Commonwealth under the existing rules, but at a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government in London in April 1949 it was agreed that India could continue its membership if it accepted the British crown as only “the symbol of the free association” of Commonwealth members. That declaration was the first to drop the adjective British, and thereafter the official name of the organization became the Commonwealth of Nations, or simply the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was also beset by other difficulties, some members opting to withdraw from the organization, as did Ireland (1949), South Africa (1961), and Pakistan (1972), though both South Africa and Pakistan eventually rejoined (the former in 1994 and the latter in 1989). Commonwealth membership grew dramatically in the second half of the 20th century as former dependencies attained sovereignty. Most of the dependent states granted independence chose Commonwealth membership, and the organization has even grown to include Mozambique (joined 1995), which was the first country granted entry that was never part of the British Empire or under the control of any member.
The Commonwealth differs from other international bodies. It has no formal constitution or bylaws. The members have no legal or formal obligation to one another; they are held together by shared traditions, institutions, and experiences as well as by economic self-interest. Commonwealth action is based upon consultation between members, which is conducted through correspondence and through conversations in meetings. Each member country sends an emissary, called a high commissioner, to the capitals of the other members. A Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is held every two years. At the meeting in Singapore in 1971, members adopted a declaration that restated the Commonwealth’s voluntary and cooperative nature and committed the organization to promoting international peace, fighting racism, opposing colonial domination, and reducing inequities in wealth. This declaration was echoed at the meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1991, when leaders further committed the organization to human rights and democracy.
Britain has huge overseas investments, both government and private, in the Commonwealth. When Britain joined the European Economic Community (later succeeded by the European Union [EU]) in 1973, the trade privileges of member countries began to be reduced. Now Commonwealth members have trade agreements with the EU. Many of the exports of Commonwealth countries go to other member countries. In 1996 the Commonwealth Africa Investment Fund was established to increase investment in that continent. There are also significant educational links between members, as many British teachers travel overseas and many students from Commonwealth members study in Britain. Other cultural links include the Commonwealth Games, a sporting competition held every four years.
In addition to independent members, the Commonwealth also comprises dependent territories, which are formally governed by the United Kingdom, Australia, or New Zealand. Most of the older dependencies are colonies. Dependencies include Anguilla, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, and the Turks and Caicos Islands (United Kingdom); Christmas Island, the Cocos Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, and Norfolk Island (Australia); and Niue and Tokelau (New Zealand). The United Kingdom has followed a policy of leading the dependencies toward self-government by creating territorial governments in them. These governments comprise a lawmaking body (often called the legislative council); an executive body (called the executive council), which with the governor is the executive authority; and an independent judiciary. At first government posts are appointive, but an increasing elected element is introduced, as constitutions are altered, until elected officials are made wholly responsible for local affairs. After a colony achieves internal self-government, its legislature may apply to the British Parliament for complete independence. It then decides whether to remain in the Commonwealth.

|Articles of Confederation|
|Created||November 15, 1777|
|Ratified||March 1, 1781|
|Location||National Archives|
|Author(s)||Continental Congress|
|Signatories||Continental Congress|
|Purpose||First constitution for the United States; replaced by the current United States Constitution on March 4, 1789|
The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution.[1] It was approved, after much debate (between July 1776 and November 1777), by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and sent to the states for ratification. The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states. The weak central government established by the Articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.[2]
The document provided clearly written rules for how the states' ""league of friendship"" would be organized. During the ratification process, the Congress looked to the Articles for guidance as it conducted business, directing the war effort, conducting diplomacy with foreign states, addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations. Little changed politically once the Articles of Confederation went into effect, as ratification did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but most Americans continued to call it the Continental Congress, since its organization remained the same.[2]
As the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after Shays' Rebellion, some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the Constitutional Convention. It was quickly agreed that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.[3] On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution.[4] The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the President), courts, and taxing powers.
Background and context
The political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin's proposed Albany Plan, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen; others would weaken, especially in the degree of loyalty (or lack thereof) owed the Crown. Civil disobedience resulted in coercive and quelling measures, such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the Intolerable Acts in the British Parliament, and armed skirmishes which resulted in dissidents being proclaimed rebels. These actions eroded the number of Crown Loyalists (Tories) among the colonials and, together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the Patriot leaders, caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government.
It was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution; a ""rulebook"" for how the new nation should function. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.[5]
To transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the ""custom of nations"" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain, in particular, could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a ""manifesto"" which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, ""[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.""[6]
Beyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time, he also urged Congress to resolve ""to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances"" and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a model treaty, and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established ""a firm league"" among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.[7]
Drafting
On June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states. The committee met frequently, and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776. Afterward, there were long debates on such issues as state sovereignty, the exact powers to be given to Congress, whether to have a judiciary, western land claims and voting procedures.[8] To further complicate work on the constitution, Congress was forced to leave Philadelphia twice, for Baltimore, Maryland, in the winter of 1776, and later for Lancaster then York, Pennsylvania, in the fall of 1777, to evade advancing British troops. Even so, the committee continued with its work.
The final draft of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was completed on November 15, 1777.[9] Consensus was achieved by: including language guaranteeing that each state retained its sovereignty, leaving the matter of western land claims in the hands of the individual states, including language stating that votes in Congress would be en bloc by state, and establishing a unicameral legislature with limited and clearly delineated powers.[10]
Ratification
The Articles of Confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in late November 1777. The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; 12 states had ratified the Articles by February 1779, 14 months into the process.[11] The lone holdout, Maryland, refused to go along until the landed states, especially Virginia, had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the Ohio River to the Union.[12] It would be two years before the Maryland General Assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through, and voted to ratify. During this time, Congress observed the Articles as its de facto frame of government. Maryland finally ratified the Articles on February 2, 1781. Congress was informed of Maryland's assent on March 1, and officially proclaimed the Articles of Confederation to be the law of the land.[11][13][14]

Article summaries
The Articles of Confederation contain a preamble, thirteen articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section. The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederation's central government. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national Congress, which was empowered to make war and peace, negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and to resolve disputes between the states. The document also stipulates that its provisions ""shall be inviolably observed by every state"" and that ""the Union shall be perpetual"".
Summary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles:
- Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: ""The stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'""
- Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government: ""Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.""
- Declares the purpose of the confederation: ""The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.""
- Elaborates upon the intent ""to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union,"" and to establish equal treatment and freedom of movement for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding ""paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice."" All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
- Allocates one vote in the Congress of the Confederation (the ""United States in Congress Assembled"") to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures. No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years.
- Only the central government may declare war, or conduct foreign political or commercial relations. No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all. No states may form any sub-national groups. No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations already proposed. No state may wage war without permission of Congress, unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-trained, disciplined, and equipped militia.
- Whenever an army is raised for common defense, the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below.
- Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each.
- Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled.Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant letters of marque and reprisal (documents authorizing privateers) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish courts for appeals in all cases of captures, but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them. Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial. The court's decision is final.Congress shall regulate the post offices; appoint officers in the military; and regulate the armed forces.The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three-year term of the Congress.Congress may request requisitions (demands for payments or supplies) from the states in proportion with their population, or take credit.Congress may not declare war, enter into treaties and alliances, appropriate money, or appoint a commander in chief without nine states assented. Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months.
- When Congress is in recess, any of the powers of Congress may be executed by ""The committee of the states, or any nine of them"", except for those powers of Congress which require nine states in Congress to execute.
- If Canada [referring to the British Province of Quebec] accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted.[16] No other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states.
- Affirms that the Confederation will honor all bills of credit incurred, monies borrowed, and debts contracted by Congress before the existence of the Articles.
- Declares that the Articles shall be perpetual, and may be altered only with the approval of Congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures.
Congress under the Articles
The army
Under the Articles, Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the Continental Army, but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, and even food.[17] Further, although the Articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers, as a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure; Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:
George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government. The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.[18]
The Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783–84. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first Secretary of War under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.[19] Knox wrote:
The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, ""A hoop to the barrel"" or ""Cement to the Union"".[20]
As Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, ""As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.""[20]
Once the war had been won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against Native American attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, George Washington defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.[21]
The Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788, the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.[22]
Foreign policy
The 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a quorum so that it could be ratified. Afterward, the problem only got worse as Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of Congress at the time, causing difficulties in raising a quorum. The resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many American nationalists, including George Washington. Many of the most prominent national leaders, such as Washington, John Adams, John Hancock, and Benjamin Franklin, retired from public life, served as foreign delegates, or held office in state governments; and for the general public, local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory. This served to exacerbate Congress's impotence.[23]
Inherent weaknesses in the confederation's frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1786, Thomas Jefferson, concerned over the failure of Congress to fund an American naval force to confront the Barbary pirates, wrote in a diplomatic correspondence to James Monroe that, ""It will be said there is no money in the treasury. There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth.""[24]
Furthermore, the 1786 Jay–Gardoqui Treaty with Spain also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty, which was never ratified, the United States was to give up rights to use the Mississippi River for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the Appalachian Mountains. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the British army to leave frontier forts which were on American soil — forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against Loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the Treaty of Paris would later be resolved by the implementation of Jay's Treaty in 1795 after the federal Constitution came into force.
Taxation and commerce
Under the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.[25]
Congress was denied any powers of taxation: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to John Jay, who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, ""that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.""[26] Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45 million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were ""the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.""[27] He argued that Americans should avoid having it said ""that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent"" or that ""her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.""[28] The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.
Congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.
Accomplishments
Nevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and it established the precedent by which the national (later, federal) government would be sovereign and expand westward—as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty.[29]
The Land Ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the Mississippi River. Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the township (36 square miles), the section (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 acres). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of Texas and California that had already been surveyed and divided up by the Spanish Empire). Then, when the Homestead Act was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.
The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims, organized the Northwest Territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the Ohio River and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, eventually became the states of: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states.
No new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the Province of Quebec (referred to as ""Canada"" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit Frankland (later modified to Franklin), Kentucky, and Vermont to the Union were considered, but none were approved.
Presidents of Congress
Under the Articles of Confederation, the presiding officer of Congress—referred to in many official records as President of the United States in Congress Assembled—chaired the Committee of the States when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions. He was not, however, an executive in the way the later President of the United States is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.[30]
There were 10 presidents of Congress under the Articles. The first, Samuel Huntington, had been serving as president of the Continental Congress since September 28, 1779.
|President||Term|
|Samuel Huntington||March 1, 1781 – July 10, 1781|
|Thomas McKean||July 10, 1781 – November 5, 1781|
|John Hanson||November 5, 1781 – November 4, 1782|
|Elias Boudinot||November 4, 1782 – November 3, 1783|
|Thomas Mifflin||November 3, 1783 – June 3, 1784|
|Richard Henry Lee||November 30, 1784 – November 4, 1785|
|John Hancock||November 23, 1785 – June 5, 1786|
|Nathaniel Gorham||June 6, 1786 – November 3, 1786|
|Arthur St. Clair||February 2, 1787 – November 4, 1787|
|Cyrus Griffin||January 22, 1788 – November 15, 1788|
The U.S. under the Articles
The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation but granted to the Congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary, and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.[31][32] Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.[33]
By 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786–87, Shays' Rebellion, an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.[34]
The Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression ""not worth a continental"". Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.[35]
When John Adams went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.[36]
By 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.[37]
The idea of a convention to revise the Articles of Confederation grew in favor. Alexander Hamilton realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the Annapolis Convention in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.[38]
Signatures
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of Henry Laurens and Charles Thomson, who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.
The Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.
On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified. North Carolina and Georgia also were unable to sign that day, since their delegations were absent.
After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.
The other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims. Chevalier de La Luzerne, French Minister to the United States, felt that the Articles would help strengthen the American government. In 1780 when Maryland requested France provide naval forces in the Chesapeake Bay for protection from the British (who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay), he indicated that French Admiral Destouches would do what he could but La Luzerne also “sharply pressed” Maryland to ratify the Articles, thus suggesting the two issues were related.[39]
On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis.[40] As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, ""among engrossed Bills"" was ""signed and sealed by Governor Thomas Sim Lee in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation"" and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned ""to the first Monday in August next."" The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The confirmation signing of the Articles by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781, and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.
Congress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.
Signers
The signers and the states they represented were:
Roger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Continental Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
Robert Morris (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
John Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).

Revision and replacement
On January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following James Madison's recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland, to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict. At what came to be known as the Annapolis Convention, the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a ""Grand Convention."" Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment, while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from Federalist 39, describes the change this way:
The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.[41]
In May 1786, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after Shays' Rebellion threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.
Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of Patrick Henry, George Mason, and other Anti-Federalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:
Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the ""consolidated government"" proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a ""splendid empire"" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.[42]
Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.
Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures ""stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.""[43] The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.
When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new ""merchant state,"" much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.[44]
Legitimacy of closing down
Political scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, John Jay of New York and Thomas Burke of North Carolina believed that ""the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.""[45]
According to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously:
[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.
On the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:
The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.
The apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion. In 1788, James Madison remarked (in Federalist No. 40) that the issue had become moot: ""As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation."" Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground. At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.[46] Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.[46]
Modern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus ""other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule"".[47] In contrast, law professor Akhil Amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.[48]
Final months
On July 3, 1788, the Congress received New Hampshire's all-important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution, thus, according to its terms, establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states. The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state. The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be ""unadvisable"" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so ""under the Articles of Confederation"" only, but not ""under the Constitution"".[49]
By the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution. Congress continued to convene under the Articles with a quorum until October.[50][51] On Saturday, September 13, 1788, the Confederation Congress voted the resolve to implement the new Constitution, and on Monday, September 15 published an announcement that the new Constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states, set the first Wednesday in February 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president, and set the first Wednesday of March 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the Articles of Confederation would come to an end.[52][53] On that same September 13, it determined that New York would remain the national capital.[52]

12,"Agreed upon by the Archbishops and Bishops of both Provinces and the whole clergy in the Convocation holden at London in the year 1562 for the avoiding of diversities of opinions and for the establishing of consent touching true religion.
Being by God's Ordinance, according to Our just Title, Defender of the Faith, and Supreme Governor of the Church, within these Our Dominions, We hold it most agreeable to this Our Kingly Office, and Our own religious Zeal, to conserve and maintain the Church committed to Our Charge, in Unity of true Religion, and in the Bond of Peace; and not to suffer unnecessary Disputations, Altercations, or Questions to be raised, which may nourish Faction both in the Church and Commonwealth. We have therefore, upon mature Deliberation, and with the Advice of so many of Our Bishops as might conveniently be called together, thought fit to make this Declaration following:
That the Articles of the Church of England (which have been allowed and authorized heretofore, and which Our Clergy generally have subscribed unto) do contain the true Doctrine of the Church of England agreeable to God's Word: which We do therefore ratify and confirm, requiring all Our loving Subjects to continue in the uniform Profession thereof, and prohibiting the least difference from the said Articles; which to that End We command to be new printed, and this Our Declaration to be published therewith.
That We are Supreme Governor of the Church of England: And that if any difference arise about the external Policy, concerning the Injunctions, Canons, and other Constitutions whatsoever thereto belonging, the Clergy in their Convocation is to order and settle them, having first obtained leave under Our Broad Seal so to do: and We approving their said Ordinances and Constitutions; providing that none be made contrary to the Laws and Customs of the Land.
That out of Our Princely Care that the Churchmen may do the Work which is proper unto them, the Bishops and Clergy, from time to time in Convocation, upon their humble Desire, shall have Licence under Our Broad Seal to deliberate of, and to do all such Things, as, being made plain by them, and assented unto by Us, shall concern the settled Continuance of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England now established; from which We will not endure any varying or departing in the least Degree.
That for the present, though some differences have been ill raised, yet We take comfort in this, that all Clergymen within Our Realm have always most willingly subscribed to the Articles established; which is an argument to Us, that they all agree in the true, usual, literal meaning of the said Articles; and that even in those curious points, in which the present differences lie, men of all sorts take the Articles of the Church of England to be for them; which is an argument again, that none of them intend any desertion of the Articles established.
That therefore in these both curious and unhappy differences, which have for so many hundred years, in different times and places, exercised the Church of Christ, We will, that all further curious search be laid aside, and these disputes shut up in God's promises, as they be generally set forth to us in the holy Scriptures, and the general meaning of the Articles of the Church of England according to them. And that no man hereafter shall either print, or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and full meaning thereof: and shall not put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.
That if any publick Reader in either of Our Universities, or any Head or Master of a College, or any other person respectively in either of them, shall affix any new sense to any Article, or shall publickly read, determine, or hold any publick Disputation, or suffer any such to be held either way, in either the Universities or Colleges respectively; or if any Divine in the Universities shall preach or print any thing either way, other than is already established in Convocation with Our Royal Assent; he, or they the Offenders, shall be liable to Our displeasure, and the Church's censure in Our Commission Ecclesiastical, as well as any other: And We will see there shall be due Execution upon them.

I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity
There is but one living and true God, ever- lasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
II. Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man
The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father, took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.
III. Of the going down of Christ into Hell
As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed, that he went down into Hell.
IV. Of the Resurrection of Christ
Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man's nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he return to judge all Men at the last day.
V. Of the Holy Ghost
The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.
VI. Of the Sufficiency of the holy Scriptures for salvation
Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the holy Scripture we do understand those Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.
Of the Names and Number of the Canonical Books
Genesis
Exodus
Leviticus
Numbers
Deuteronomy
Joshua
Judges
Ruth
The First Book of Samuel
The Second Book of Samuel
The First Book of Kings
The Second Book of Kings
The First Book of Chronicles
The Second Book of Chronicles
The First Book of Esdras
The Second Book of Esdras
The Book of Esther
The Book of Job
The Psalms
The Proverbs
Ecclesiastes or Preacher
Cantica, or Songs of Solomon
Four Prophets the greater
Twelve Prophets the less
And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine; such are these following:
The Third Book of Esdras
The Fourth Book of Esdras
The Book of Tobias
The Book of Judith
The rest of the Book of Esther
The Book of Wisdom
Jesus the Son of Sirach
Baruch the Prophet
The Song of the Three Children
The Story of Susanna
Of Bel and the Dragon
The Prayer of Manasses
The First Book of Maccabees
The Second Book of Maccabees
All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them Canonical.
VII. Of the Old Testament
The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.
VIII. Of the Three Creeds
The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of holy Scripture.
IX. Of Original or Birth-sin
Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is ingendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek, ""Phronema Sarkos"", which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.
X. Of Free-Will
The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us, when we have that good will.
XI. Of the Justification of Man
We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings: Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only is a most wholesome Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.
XII. Of Good Works
Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's Judgement; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that by them a lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.
XIII. Of Works before Justification
Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of sin.
XIV. Of Works of Supererogation
Voluntary Works besides, over, and above, God's Commandments, which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.
XV. Of Christ alone without Sin
Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself once made, should take away the sins of the world, and sin, as Saint John saith, was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
XVI. Of Sin after Baptism
Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.
XVII. Of Predestination and Election
Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God's purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.
As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous downfal, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.
Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of God.
XVIII. Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ
They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.
XIX. Of the Church
The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same.
As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.
XX. Of the Authority of the Church
The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of Salvation.
XXI. Of the Authority of General Councils
General Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and will of Princes. And when they be gathered together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word of God,) they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture.
XXII. Of Purgatory
The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping, and Adoration, as well of Images as of Reliques, and also invocation of Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.
XXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation
It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of publick preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same.
And those we ought to judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who have publick authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call and send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.
XXIV. Of speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the people understandeth
It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church, to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people.
XXV. Of the Sacraments
Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men's profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and God's good will towards us, by the which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.
There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.
Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.
The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.
XXVI. Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament
Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving of the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ's institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.
Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally being found guilty, by just judgement be deposed.
XXVII. Of Baptism
Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is also a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.
XXVIII. Of the Lord's Supper
The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.
Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.
The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.
The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.
XXIX. Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the Lord's Supper
The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.
XXX. Of both kinds
The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment, ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.
XXXI. Of the one Oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross
The Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.
XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's Law, either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.
XXXIII. Of Excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided
That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a Judge that hath authority thereunto.
XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church
It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, and utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed according to the diversities of countries, times, and men's manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's Word. Whosoever through his private judgement, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the traditions and ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak brethren.
Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and abolish, ceremonies or rites of the Church ordained only by man's authority, so that all things be done to edifying.
XXXV. Of the Homilies
The second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be understanded of the people.
Of the Names of the Homilies
1.Of the right Use of the Church.
2.Against peril of Idolatry.
3.Of repairing and keeping clean of Churches.
4.Of good Works: first of Fasting.
5.Against Gluttony and Drunkenness.
6.Against Excess of Apparel.
7.Of Prayer.
8.Of the Place and Time of Prayer.
9.That Common Prayers and Sacraments ought to be ministered in a known tongue.
10.Of the reverend estimation of God's Word.
11.Of Alms-doing.
12.Of the Nativity of Christ.
13.Of the Passion of Christ.
14.Of the Resurrection of Christ.
15.Of the worthy receiving of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ.
16.Of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost.
17.For the Rogation-days.
18.Of the State of Matrimony.
19.Of Repentance.
20.Against Idleness.
21.Against Rebellion.
XXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers
The Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth, and confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, doth contain all things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering: neither hath it any thing, that of itself is superstitious and ungodly. And therefore whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that Book, since the second year of the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites; we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.
XXXVII. Of the Civil Magistrates
The King's Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and other his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign Jurisdiction.
Where we attribute to the King's Majesty the chief government, by which Titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended; we give not to our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queen do most plainly testify; but that only prerogative, which we see to have been given always to all godly
Princes in holy Scriptures by God himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.
The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.
The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and grievous offences.
It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.
XXXVIII. Of Christian men's Goods, which are not common
The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right, title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth, liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.
XXXIX. Of a Christian man's Oath
As we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge, that Christian Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the Prophet's teaching, in justice, judgement, and truth.
This Book of Articles before rehearsed, is again approved, and allowed to be holden and executed within the Realm, by the assent and consent of our Sovereign Lady ELIZABETH, by the grace of God, of England, France, and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, &c. Which Articles were deliberately read, and confirmed again by the subscription of the hands of the Archbishop and Bishops of the Upper-house, and by the subscription of the whole Clergy of the Nether-house in their Convocation, in the Year of our Lord 1571.

13,"Utrecht, Treaty of
Utrecht, Treaty of, an agreement between Britain and France concluded 11 Apr 1713 at Utrecht in the Netherlands as part of the series of treaties ending the War of the Spanish Succession. The treaty recognized Queen Anne as the legitimate sovereign of England and officially ended French support for the claims of the Jacobite party to the British throne. Territorially, it resulted in major concessions by France in N America. France agreed to restore the entire drainage basin of Hudson Bay to Britain and to compensate the Hudson's Bay Co for losses suffered during the war. In addition, France agreed to cede all claims to Newfoundland and to evacuate its base there at Plaisance (Placentia), although French fishermen retained certain rights on the Newfoundland coasts (see French Shore). Moreover, Acadia, whose capital of Port-Royal (Annapolis Royal) had been captured by a New England expedition in 1710, was to pass to Britain, although France continued in possession of a part of the territory (modern New Brunswick) because of differences of interpretation in the size of the territory. Lastly, France retained Cape Breton I, where it began to construct the fortress of Louisbourg and Ile Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island)."

The Basel Committee set up a high-level Task Force on Sovereign Exposures to review the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures and to recommend potential policy options. The Task Force submitted a report to the Committee that analysed various issues concerning the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures in the Basel framework. The Committee has now completed its review. This discussion paper has been derived from the Task Force’s report. The Committee’s view is that the issues raised by the Task Force and the potential ideas outlined in this paper are important, and could benefit from a broader discussion. At this stage, the Committee has not reached a consensus to make any changes to the treatment of sovereign exposures, and has therefore decided not to consult on the ideas presented in this paper. The views of interested stakeholders will nevertheless be highly useful in informing the Committee’s longer-term thinking on this issue. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Chapter 1 provides some background about the Committee’s review of sovereign exposures. The Committee is of the view that all sovereign exposures entail risks but notes that they also play an important role in the banking system, financial markets and the broader economy. The ideas set out in this discussion paper therefore seek to balance prudential risk with other holistic considerations that are relevant to the Committee’s mandate of enhancing financial stability. Chapter 2 reviews the main sources and channels of sovereign risk in the banking system. Sovereign risk has various dimensions. Historically, banking crises have preceded, accompanied and followed sovereign crises. The “sovereign-bank nexus” is multifaceted, potentially serving as an amplifier and/or absorber of shocks in times of stress. Sovereign exposures play an important and heterogeneous role across different markets and jurisdictions. As discussed in Chapter 3, sovereign exposures are used by banks for liquidity management, credit risk mitigation, asset pricing, financial intermediation and investment purposes. Banks’ holdings of sovereign exposures also play an important role as part of monetary policy operationalisation. As banks are generally one of the main investors in government debt, they also play a role in the operationalisation of fiscal policy. The current regulatory treatment could potentially exacerbate the negative aspects of the sovereign-bank nexus. The existing regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures is considered in Chapter 4. In most cases, the existing treatment of sovereign exposures is more favourable than other asset classes. Most notably, the risk-weighted framework includes a national discretion that allows jurisdictions to apply a 0% risk weight for sovereign exposures denominated and funded in domestic currency, regardless of their inherent risk. This discretion is currently exercised by all members of the Committee. Sovereign exposures are also currently exempted from the large exposures framework. Moreover, no limits or haircuts are applied to domestic sovereign exposures that are eligible as high-quality liquid assets in meeting the liquidity standards. In contrast, sovereign exposures are included as part of the leverage ratio framework. Chapter 5 sets out some ideas regarding the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. It starts by reviewing the existing perimeter and segmentation of sovereign exposures and presents the Committee’s discussions on possible revisions to the definition of sovereign entities to ensure greater consistency across jurisdictions. It then outlines ideas related to revising the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. These can be grouped into three broad categories. The first set of ideas relates to: (i) the removal of the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach framework for sovereign exposures; (ii) revised standardised risk weights for sovereign exposures held in both the banking and trading book, including the removal of the national discretion to apply a preferential risk weight for certain sovereign exposures; and (iii) adjustments to the existing credit risk mitigation framework, including the removal of the national 2 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures discretion to set a zero haircut for certain sovereign repo-style transactions. The calibrations in this discussion paper are presented only for illustrative purposes. The second set of ideas relate to mitigating the potential risks of excessive holdings of sovereign exposures, which, for instance, could take the form of marginal risk weight add-ons that would vary based on the degree of a bank’s concentration to a sovereign (defined as the proportion of sovereign exposures relative to Tier 1 capital). The third set of ideas is related to the Pillar 2 (supervisory review process) and Pillar 3 (disclosure) treatment of sovereign exposures. Regarding the former, these include ideas related to guidance on: (i) monitoring sovereign risk; (ii) stress testing for sovereign risk; and (iii) supervisory responses to mitigating sovereign risk. Regarding the Pillar 3 framework, this paper includes ideas related to disclosure requirements related to banks’ exposures and risk-weighted assets of different sovereign entities by jurisdictional breakdown, currency breakdown and accounting classification. The Basel framework applies to all internationally active banks on a fully consolidated basis or at every tier within a group. To mitigate potential concerns related to different prudential treatments applied at a subsidiary and consolidated level, the Committee encourages home authorities of internationally active banks to recognise the prudential treatment applied by host authorities for subsidiaries, to the extent that the latter is compliant with the Basel framework. The Committee notes that home authorities retain the option to apply higher risk weights at a consolidated level if necessary. In addition, some of the ideas in this discussion paper are related to removing the existing national discretions related to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures, which would contribute towards a consistent minimum prudential treatment at the consolidated and sub-consolidated levels within and across different jurisdictions. As noted above, the Committee welcomes comments on the analyses and ideas set out in this discussion paper from all stakeholders, including academics, analysts, debt management agencies, finance ministries, market participants and the general public. Comments on any elements of this discussion paper should be submitted by 9 March 2018 using the following link: www.bis.org/bcbs/commentupload.htm. All comments may be published on the website of the Bank for International Settlements unless a respondent specifically requests confidential treatment. http://www.bis.org/bcbs/commentupload.htm The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 3 Chapter 1: Introduction The Committee’s post-crisis reforms have been extensive and far-reaching, addressing some of the main fault lines with the pre-crisis regulatory framework.1 Yet these reforms have kept the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures broadly unchanged from the Basel II framework, and, in some cases, from the Basel I framework. The recent post-crisis episodes of sovereign distress across different regions and jurisdictions have served as a reminder that sovereign exposures entail risks. In January 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision initiated a review of the existing regulatory treatment of sovereign risk.2 It set up a high-level Task Force on Sovereign Exposures to review the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures and to recommend potential policy options. The Task Force submitted a report to the Committee that analysed various issues concerning the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures in the Basel framework. The Committee has now completed its review. This discussion paper has been derived from the Task Force’s report. The Committee recognises that sovereign exposures entail multidimensional risks, and that sovereign exposures play an important role in the banking system, financial markets and the broader economy. The Committee’s view is that the issues raised by the Task Force and the potential ideas outlined in this paper are important, and could benefit from a broader discussion. At this stage, the Committee has not reached a consensus to make any changes to the treatment of sovereign exposures, and has therefore decided not to consult on the ideas presented in this paper. The views of interested stakeholders will nevertheless be highly useful in informing the Committee’s longer-term thinking on this issue. This discussion paper sets out the Committee’s analysis on the sources and channels of sovereign risk in the banking system, and includes ideas related to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. 1 See the Committee’s report to G20 Leaders in November 2015 for a summary of its post-crisis reforms, available at www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d344.pdf. 2 As discussed in the Basel Committee’s work programme for 2015 and 2016, available at www.bis.org/bcbs/about/work_programme.htm. 4 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Chapter 2: Sources and channels of sovereign risk in the banking system This chapter briefly reviews the sources and channels of sovereign risk in the banking system. It builds on the vast theoretical and empirical literature on sovereign risk. Sovereign risk and the banking system Sovereign exposures can generate a range of risks for banks. These risks are multidimensional, and include credit, interest rate, market and refinancing risk. They can arise from myriad actual or expected events, including: (i) missed payments; (ii) debt restructuring or outright defaults; (iii) currency redenomination; (iii) currency devaluations; (iv) losses from unanticipated, higher inflation; and (v) fluctuations in the value of sovereign exposures.3 These risks can affect the banking system through various channels.4 These include: (i) a direct exposures channel, whereby increased sovereign risk can inflict losses on banks’ sovereign exposures, weakening their balance sheets; (ii) a collateral channel, where an increase in sovereign risk can reduce the value of sovereign collateral used by banks, raising funding costs and liquidity needs; (iii) sovereign credit rating downgrades, which generate cliff effects and may precipitate downgrades to the ratings of other entities in the economy given that sovereign ratings set a “ceiling” on other credit ratings; (iv) a government support channel, where a weakening of the sovereign could reduce the funding benefits that banks derive from implicit and/or explicit government guarantees. A number of post-crisis reforms (eg resolution regimes) seek to weaken this channel; and (v) a macroeconomic channel, whereby the crystallisation of sovereign risk could trigger a recession, which in turn could increase borrowers’ riskiness and banks’ fragility and funding costs, resulting in a spiral of credit tightening that deepens the recession, independently of banks’ direct exposures to the sovereign. These channels, in isolation or in combination, can make banks more susceptible to distress or failure, increasing the risk of contagion to the rest of the banking system. The causality can also run in the opposite direction: a banking crisis can increase sovereign risk.5 For example, if a government is expected to support the banks in a banking crisis, a strained banking system could erode the sovereign’s own creditworthiness. More generally, a banking crisis resulting in a reduction in lending and worse economic conditions could stretch the sovereign’s fiscal position. This interconnectedness of banks and sovereigns is often referred to as the sovereign-bank “nexus”, whereby problems originating in one of the two sectors may cause a negative “feedback loop” that further amplifies the effects in each sector.6 3 See, for example, IMF (2011), Dudley (2013), and Pericoli and Taboga (2015). 4 See, for example, CGFS (2011), Acharya et al (2012), and Correa and Sapriza (2014). 5 See, for example, Panetta et al (2009) and Gartner et al (2013). 6 Van Rixtel and Gasperini (2013). The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 5 On the other hand, banks can also act as shock absorbers in times of distress when they act as stable and willing investors in sovereign debt. The recent financial crisis has provided several instances of this role. 7 Furthermore, sovereign defaults may be less likely to occur in countries where domestic agents/banks hold more domestic sovereign debt, as this concentrates the costs of a government default on resident citizens and banks, thus creating a commitment device for the sovereign.8 In addition, a high proportion of sovereign debt held domestically reduces the dependence on external investors, who are typically more prone to taking flight in the presence of shocks, thus potentially subjecting governments to refinancing risk.9 The impact of the bank-sovereign nexus depends on a number of factors, including jurisdiction- specific factors, the size of the existing dependence between banks and the sovereign, and the magnitude of the crisis. For example, in a moderate stress event and when the degree of dependence is relatively low before the stress event, banks may be better positioned to act as shock absorbers. However, in a more severe stress event, or where banks’ holdings of sovereign exposures are relatively high before the stress event, the bank-sovereign nexus could aggravate the crisis. Empirical evidence on sovereign risk There is a long history of sovereign distress episodes, as evidenced by the events following the global financial crisis across different regions and jurisdictions. This record suggests that banking crises have preceded, accompanied and followed sovereign crises.10 Sovereign distress can take many forms, ranging from outright default to non-default events, including: (i) sovereign default or debt restructuring for fundamental reasons: the sovereign is unable to meet its debt obligations or is required to restructure its debt obligations in order to be able to continue to meet them because its current fiscal position is unsustainable. Examples include Pakistan (1999), Ukraine (2000), Ecuador (2009) and Greece (2012); (ii) a technical default by a sovereign for non-fundamental reasons. a temporary disruption to coupon payments even though there are no fundamental problems or concerns about fiscal sustainability. Examples include the United States (1979); (iii) currency redenomination or the risk of one (“real default”): a change in the currency in which sovereign debt is denominated or a change in the exchange rate policy that leads to a revaluation by creditors of the sovereign debt. Examples include the Czech-Slovak monetary union collapse (1993) or the perceived risk during the euro area debt crisis (2012);11 (iv) monetary policy geared towards inflating debt away (another type of “real default”): whereby intentional inflationary policies reduce the real value of the sovereign’s debt. Examples include Germany (1923), Argentina (1989), Brazil (1987, 1990), and Turkey (1990, 1994);12 7 See, for example, Lanotte et al (2016). 8 See, for example, Ichiue and Shimizu (2012), and Gennaioli et al (2014). 9 See, for example, Arslanalp and Tsuda (2012). 10 See, for example, Reinhart and Rogoff (2011), and Schularick and Taylor (2012). 11 See, for example, De Santis (2015). 12 See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) for additional examples. 6 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures (v) default by a quasi-sovereign entity: an issuer that is fully or partially owned by a sovereign defaults on its debt. Examples include Naftogaz (2009), Dubai World (2009–10) and Ukreximbank (2015) and (vi) sovereign downgrades and/or market stress (non-default) events: a sovereign’s credit rating is downgraded and/or the risk premium attached to the sovereign’s debt or related instruments (eg credit default swaps) is increased without necessarily a preceding sovereign default. Examples include Sweden and Finland (1990s), Korea (1997–98) and the recent euro area debt crisis. The frequency of defaults or debt restructurings has fluctuated over time, with such events often coming in waves associated with conflict or regional instability (Graph 1). The frequency of such episodes in the sovereigns of higher-income regions has tended to be lower than for other sovereigns over much of the past two centuries. In developing economies, outright defaults have historically been more frequent than in advanced economies (although they are now less frequent than in the 1980s and 1990s). Graph 1: Frequency of sovereign defaults(a) Sources: Reinhart and Rogoff (2010); Basel Committee calculations. (a) The frequency of default is defined as the ratio of the number of new defaults in a given year over the total number of countries in the sample. The graph shows the average frequency of default over 10-year moving windows. The definition of default includes episodes in which debt is ultimately extinguished in terms less favourable than the original obligation. The data end in 2010, which means, for instance, that the recent Greek sovereign distress episode is not included. Focusing on higher income economies, the frequency of external sovereign debt crises is higher than the frequency of domestic sovereign debt crises (Table 1). This may be because it is harder for a sovereign to meet obligations that are denominated in a currency that is not its own, and because the costs of external defaults tend to be borne by non-residents. The frequencies of both domestic and external crises have fallen over time. Moreover, the historical frequency of sovereign debt crises is lower than that of other types of economic crisis. Outright defaults by central banks on local currency liabilities have historically been very rare. But some have still occurred, although they were generally associated with monetary reforms or currency conversions.13 Table 1 shows the number of actual distress events from 1800 to 2010 (it does not include events after 2010 due to data limitations), but it omits other instances in which a default or restructuring event was averted by public sector intervention, such as an IMF programme.

(a) Average GDP per capital in the period 2003–13. (b) Sovereign crises, which are divided into domestic and external, are defined as the failure to meet a principal or interest payment on the due date (or within the specified grace period). The episodes also include instances where rescheduled debt is ultimately extinguished in terms less favourable than the original obligation. External debt crises involve default on a government’s external debt, ie a default on a payment to creditors of a loan issued under another country’s jurisdiction (and typically, but not always, denominated in foreign currency and mostly held by foreign investors). A domestic debt crisis involves public debt issued under a country’s own legal jurisdiction. In most countries, domestic debt has been denominated in the local currency, and held mainly by residents. In addition, domestic debt crises may involve the freezing of bank deposits and or forcible conversions of such deposits from dollars to local currency. (c) A currency crisis is defined as an annual depreciation versus the relevant anchor currency (eg the US dollar) of 15% or more. An inflation crisis is defined as an annual rate of inflation of 20% or more. A banking crisis is where there are bank runs that led to the closure, merging or takeover by the public sector of one or more financial institutions or, in the absence of runs, there was a closure, merger or public sector takeover of an important financial institution or group of institutions that marked the beginning of series of similar events for other financial institutions. An equity market crisis is defined as a cumulative decline of 25% or more in real equity prices from a peak to trough in equity prices. (d) The frequency of default or other crises is defined as the ratio of the number of new defaults/crises in a given year over the total number of countries in the relevant sample averaged over the specific time period. Sovereign debt crises have generally been associated with significant financial and macroeconomic impacts. Direct loss-given-default rates for sovereign debt holders have varied widely but on average since the 1970s have been around 40% (Graphs 2 and 3).14 14 Cruces and Trebesch (2013). http://www.carmenreinhart.com/data/browse-by-topic/topics/7/ 8 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Graph 2: Quartile distribution of sovereign default haircuts to private creditors (1978–2013)(a) Sources: Cruces and Trebesch (2013); Basel Committee calculations. (a) Boxplots shows the 25th quartile, the median, and the 75th quartile over the period considered.

Graph 3: Sovereign default haircuts by region (to private creditors) Sources: Cruces and Trebesch (2013); Basel Committee calculations. While studies on the broader economic impact of sovereign distress vary, some suggest that output growth falls on average by around 6 percentage points, with effects that persist long after the crisis.15 Sovereign crises often coincide with banking and/or currency crises, which tends to increase the duration and size of output losses associated with the crisis (Table 2). Therefore, losses on sovereign exposures may represent a macroprudential risk to banks. At the same time, the major risk from a sovereign crisis for banks stems from the various indirect transmission channels outlined above. 15 De Paoli et al (2009), Furceri and Zdzienicka (2012). -20% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Western Europe Eastern Europe Latin American and the Caribbean Africa and Middle East Asia Average -20% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1973 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013 Africa and Middle East Asia Eastern Europe Latin American and the Caribbean Western Europe http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1943411 http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1943411 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 9 Table 2: Duration and output losses per year conditional on different types of financial crisis(a)(b) Type of crisis Number of crisis Average duration (years) Average GDP loss (%, relative to counterfactual on a per annum basis) Median duration (years) Median GDP loss (%, relative to counterfactual on a per annum basis) Sovereign crisis only 1 4.0 2.5 4.0 2.5 Sovereign and banking crises 4 11.0 4.9 10.5 7.6 Sovereign and currency crises 10 8.9 13.7 9.5 14.3 Triple crises 17 12.5 12.7 14.0 11.1 All 32 10.9 11.8 11.5 10.6 Source: De Paoli et al (2009). (a) A sovereign debt crisis is defined as an episode when there is either an actual default (defined as when the arrears on principal on external obligations towards private creditors reach at least 15% of total commercial debt outstanding or the arrears on interest on external obligations towards private creditors reach at least 5% of total commercial debt outstanding) and/or there is a rescheduling with private creditors as listed in the World Bank’s Global Development Finance. (b) Output losses are measured by comparing realised output with a counterfactual output estimated using a model that, aside from the debt crisis itself, explains output growth (per head) by the ratio of investment to GDP, the ratio of government consumption to GDP, inflation, the degree of trade openness and a measure of political instability. Sovereign stress can also affect banks without there being either an outright default or debt restructuring. For example, changes in the prospects for the economy or the fiscal position can affect the market value of sovereign exposures, with or without changes in the ratings of sovereign debt (Graph 4). This in turn could change the value of government debt as collateral, and in turn affecting banks’ funding costs.

In the recent period, there have been numerous sovereign downgrades. Graph 5: Sovereign downgrades by Moody’s Sources: Moody’s; Basel Committee calculations. More generally, the value of sovereign assets can change because of prospects for inflation. Historically, sovereign stress has been associated with increased inflationary pressures, perhaps reflecting governments choosing to reduce the real burden of domestic debt by increasing inflation. More recently, the global move towards central bank operational independence may have reduced the risk of this happening. Historical data show that high inflation (defined as an inflation rate of 20% or more) was present in around one in five years in which there was an external sovereign debt crisis in a country, with this figure rising to one in three for domestic sovereign debt crises.16 Post-crisis reforms and macroeconomic trends related to sovereign risk The nature of sovereign risk could change as a result of post-crisis reforms (directly or indirectly) related to sovereign risk. For example, there have been institutional changes in the approaches to crisis resolution. The IMF has recently removed its systemic risk exemption to promote more efficient resolution of sovereign debt problems, which might mean that large-scale official sector financing will not be provided without debt reduction, including via restructuring.17 These reforms could result in a greater possibility of banks incurring losses on their sovereign exposures. Meanwhile, arrangements for bank resolution have received greater attention in the recent past, aiming to put an end to “too big to fail” and to mitigate the risk of banking sector problems that impair the sovereign’s creditworthiness. For example, the Financial Stability Board has adopted the Key Attributes 16 This is based on the data in Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). 17 See www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sopol012916a. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 N um be r of d ow ng ra de s Africa and the Middle East Asia Eastern Europe Latin America and the Caribbean Western Europe North America Australasia and the Pacific The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 11 of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, and agreed to total loss-absorbing capacity requirements (TLAC) for global systemically important banks.18 The adoption of bail-in regimes could substantially reduce the risk that a banking crisis is transmitted directly to the domestic sovereign via the government support channel. As such, there is a greater possibility of banks continuing as going concerns after a period of stress, with bank creditors potentially incurring greater losses. Another factor that could change the dynamics of sovereign risk in the future is structurally higher sovereign indebtedness. Levels of public debt in some economies have been increasing over the past decade (Graph 6), and are now around twice their average level over the historical period generally covered in the literature. In addition, any changes to the current low interest rate environment in many jurisdictions could have an impact on the valuation of sovereign exposures.

Q1. Are there any additional sources and channels of sovereign risk in the banking system that are relevant to, and that should be captured in, the prudential regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures? 18 The Key Attributes are available at www.fsb.org/what-we-do/policy-development/effective-resolution-regimes-and- policies/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions, and the TLAC standard is available at www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/TLAC-Principles-and-Term-Sheet-for-publication-final.pdf. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 20 01 20 02 20 03 20 04 20 05 20 06 20 07 20 08 20 09 20 10 20 11 20 12 20 13 20 14 20 15 Advanced economies Emerging market economies% http://www.fsb.org/what-we-do/policy-development/effective-resolution-regimes-and-policies/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions http://www.fsb.org/what-we-do/policy-development/effective-resolution-regimes-and-policies/key-attributes-of-effective-resolution-regimes-for-financial-institutions http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/TLAC-Principles-and-Term-Sheet-for-publication-final.pdf 12 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Chapter 3: The holistic role of sovereign exposures Chapter 2 reviewed the sources and channels of sovereign risk in the banking system. From a holistic perspective, sovereign exposures play an important role in financial markets and the broader economy, including in monetary policy implementation. Banks use their sovereign holdings for a variety of reasons, including for liquidity management, credit risk mitigation, asset pricing as well as a profit-generating investment. This chapter considers these roles in more detail. Determinants of banks’ holdings of sovereign exposures Banks hold sovereign exposures for a host of reasons, including the following: • balance sheet management: sovereign securities can be useful for banks’ balance sheet management. This includes liquidity management, where sovereign exposures are used as collateral. 19 In many jurisdictions, sovereign securities are usually the most liquid assets. 20 Sovereign securities are also used as part of banks’ role in payment systems and in the operationalisation of monetary policy (see below); • role in market-making: some banks hold sovereign debt as part of their role as primary dealers or market-makers for such exposures; • legislation and regulation: as discussed in Chapter 4, the existing regulatory framework provides a more favourable capital treatment for sovereign exposures than for other exposures, which may incentivise banks to hold such debt. In addition, the liquidity standards require banks to hold a buffer of liquid assets, which include sovereign debt. Some jurisdictions also rule that a certain percentage of banks’ assets should be held in sovereign securities; • fragmentation: banks may increase their domestic sovereign holdings in times of stress in response to a fragmentation of financial markets associated with a pullback by foreign investors;21 • investment opportunities: sovereign exposures may at times be perceived as the most attractive risk-return investment. For example, banks may rebalance their portfolios during downturns and favour sovereign exposures relative to other investments (eg a “flight to safety” effect and as a result of a lack of other sustainable alternative investment options). 22 In exceptional circumstances, banks may engage in carry trade or “gambling for resurrection” behaviour. These reasons interact in different ways with sovereign risk and the transmission of these risks to banks. Some of the reasons may play a role only during crisis times, while other reasons also affect bank holdings in normal times. There is empirical evidence for some of these reasons, but empirically, it is not straightforward to clearly distinguish between the different factors, and banks may hold parts of their portfolio for different reasons. More generally, to the extent that the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures incentivises banks’ holdings of sovereign exposures relative to other asset classes, there could also be an impact on the allocation of resources in the economy (eg holdings of sovereign exposures could potentially “crowd out” the provision of lending to the private sector). 19 Gennaioli et al (2012). 20 Correa and Sapriza (2014). 21 European Systemic Risk Board (2015) and Battistini et al (2013). 22 Castro and Mencia (2014). The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 13 Overall, public debt levels and associated bank holdings vary widely between countries. This reflects many factors including government finances, the size and development of the financial system (including the size of banks), cyclical factors, regulatory requirements, and the impact of the global financial crisis. Virtually all public debt in advanced economies, and in most emerging market economies, is denominated in local currency. Role of central government bonds in financial markets Central government bonds play an important role in financial markets as collateral, liquid assets and as a reference rate for other securities. Some government bonds are extensively used in securities financing transactions and as collateral in derivatives transactions. In many jurisdictions, central government debt markets are the deepest and most liquid markets.23 As such, sovereign exposures can be an important element in the collateral management of financial institutions. Given their collateral function, sovereign bonds are a means of transaction in financial markets. The ease with which sovereign exposures can be liquidated and collateralised promotes their use as liquid assets. Sovereign exposures thus play an important role in liquidity management. Central government debt is also used to price financial assets. In financial theory, the concept of a “risk-free interest rate” – the return on a perfectly liquid bond carrying no credit risk – plays an important role in the valuation of securities. Central government bonds are often viewed as a proxy for “risk-free rates” because they carry less idiosyncratic risk than other assets in the domestic economy. The theoretical notion of the risk-free rate is therefore typically measured by the yield on (high-rated) central government bonds, and these bonds serve as an anchor for the pricing of other assets in the domestic economy. Role of sovereign exposures for monetary policy Sovereign exposures matter for the conduct of monetary policy in two main ways. First, they play a role in monetary policy implementation, which typically involves transactions in government debt and central bank liabilities. Second, sovereign debt typically plays a role in the transmission of monetary policy through financial markets, for instance, by serving as collateral in repo markets or through the pricing of financial assets against government debt (as discussed above). Changes in monetary policy are often implemented through open market operations, which can include central bank reserves or the issuance of central bank bills as well as securities against which reserves are exchanged. Central bank reserves typically increase with liquidity-providing operations and decline with liquidity-absorbing operations. Similarly, central banks may issue bills or sell foreign currency to absorb liquidity and vice versa. Central government bonds are often used as collateral by eligible counterparties to obtain central bank funding. In addition, central bank outright purchases of assets, by and large, involve mainly sovereign debt. While central banks could use different financial assets to steer the amount of commercial banks’ reserves held at the central bank, using sovereign securities has advantages over other alternatives for the implementation of monetary policy. Given the relatively large size and high liquidity of sovereign debt 23 Committee on the Global Financial System (1999). 14 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures markets, central banks can carry out large transactions without disrupting markets and liquidity. 24 Furthermore, by using sovereign securities rather than a few private publicly traded assets to implement open market operations, central banks do not distort the allocation of private capital within the economy.25 In many jurisdictions, government bonds are therefore important in the implementation of monetary policy and in the early stages of the transmission process. Central government bonds are also important in the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. In calculating the present value of investment projects or the value of future financial payments, investors generally draw on government bond yields as a proxy for the “risk-free interest rates”. Furthermore, given their benchmark status, government bond yields directly impact the market-based funding costs of firms. Government bonds also play an important role in the bank intermediation process, influencing the supply and cost of bank credit. As noted above, in many jurisdictions banks hold sovereign bonds for liquidity management purposes. These bonds are widely used to obtain funding in repo markets, facilitating maturity transformation and the flow of credit to the real economy. Role of sovereign exposures for fiscal policy By definition, fiscal policy strategies based on deficit-financed spending rely on the issuance of sovereign bonds. The “automatic stabiliser” features of fiscal policy could also result in a reliance on debt financing at certain points of the economic cycle. In principle, well developed domestic government bond markets are a prerequisite for some forms of fiscal policy. In particular, deep and liquid sovereign bond markets allow governments to finance part of their expenditure through debt issuance at a minimum cost. To facilitate the issuance of government debt, fiscal authorities aim to ensure a sufficiently liquid sovereign bond market, with a deep and diversified investor base. While the current composition of the investor base of government debt markets varies across countries (Graph 7), banks are an important part of the government debt investor base in many countries, either as outright investors or as market-makers and primary dealers in government debt markets. Other key investors in jurisdictions where banks only hold a small share of government debt include domestic and foreign non-bank financial institutions (eg insurance companies, pension and investment funds), foreign governments (eg as part of those governments’ foreign exchange reserves) and central banks. 24 Some central banks avoid using their own securities to prevent domestic market fragmentation and any consequent reduction in market liquidity. 25 See Greenspan (2001).

(b) Claims on domestic government following IMF definition for general government debt, which includes central, state and local governments. Heterogeneity and global standards The Committee recognises that the specific roles of sovereign exposures may vary across jurisdictions due to the heterogeneity in banks’ business models, market structures and macro-financial balances. For example, while banks’ current holdings of sovereign exposures are generally lower than before (Graphs 8 and 9), the relative holdings across jurisdictions can differ significantly. 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% C hi na Tu rk ey A us tr al ia R us si a Sp ai n It al y Ja p an In d ia G er m an y N et he rl an d s So ut h A fr ic a Be lg iu m C an ad a Fr an ce A rg en tin a Br az il Sw ed en In d o ne si a Sw itz er la nd M ex ic o Ko re a U ni te d S ta te s U ni te d K in g d o m Foreign official sector Foreign non-bank financial institutions Foreign banks Central bank Domestic non-bank financial institutions Domestic banking sector 16 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Graph 8: Bank claims on domestic government debt – advanced economies (% of assets)(a)(b) Sources: IMF, national sources; Basel Committee estimates.

The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 17 The Committee’s discussion on the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures aimed to balance the benefits of globally harmonised minimum prudential standards with jurisdiction-specific characteristics in considering the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. Q2. Are there additional roles of sovereign exposures in financial markets and the broader economy that are of relevance to the prudential regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures? 18 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Chapter 4: The existing regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures This chapter summarises the existing Basel regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. It covers the treatment of sovereign exposures under the risk-weighted framework (including credit and market risk), large exposures framework, leverage ratio framework and liquidity standards.26 In most cases, the existing treatment of sovereign exposures is more favourable than other asset classes (Table 3). Most notably, the risk-weighted framework includes a national discretion for jurisdictions to apply a preferential risk weight for sovereign exposures denominated and funded in domestic currency. In addition, sovereign exposures are currently not included in the large exposures framework. Finally, no limits or haircuts are applied to domestic sovereign exposures that are eligible as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) as part of the liquidity standards. In contrast, sovereign exposures are included as part of the leverage ratio framework.

Risk-weighted framework The risk-weighted framework sets capital requirements for sovereign exposures to mitigate credit risk and market risk.

Standardised approach for credit risk Under the existing standardised approach, sovereign exposures are defined as exposures to central governments, central banks, international organisations, certain multilateral development banks and, subject to national discretion, certain non-central government public sector entities (PSEs). Claims on other PSEs are treated as exposures to banks. Exposures to sovereigns and central banks are risk-weighted based on a ratings-based look-up table (Table 4). Alternatively, supervisors may recognise the country risk scores assigned by qualifying export credit agencies.27 This table applies to sovereign exposures denominated in the domestic currency of the issuer and in any foreign currency. Table 4: Current standardised approach look-up table for exposures to sovereigns and central banks Credit assessment AAA to AA– A+ to A– BBB+ to BBB– BB+ to B– Below B– Unrated Risk weight 0% 20% 50% 100% 150% 100% At national discretion, a lower risk weight may be applied to banks’ exposures to their sovereign (or central bank) of incorporation denominated in domestic currency and funded in that currency. 28 Where this discretion is exercised, other national supervisory authorities may also permit their banks to apply the same risk weight to domestic currency exposures to this sovereign (or central bank) funded in that currency.29 In practice, all Committee members currently exercise this discretion and set a 0% risk weight. On average, banks’ risk weight for central government exposures (including both domestic and foreign- currency exposures) under the standardised approach is currently about 3%. 30 Claims on non-central government PSEs are risk weighted as exposures to banks. Subject to national discretion, claims on certain domestic PSEs may also be treated as claims on the sovereigns in whose jurisdictions the PSEs are established. Where this discretion is exercised, other national supervisors may allow their banks to risk-weight claims on such PSEs in the same manner.31 Claims on the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Community may currently receive a 0% risk weight. In addition, a 0% risk weight is applied to claims on highly rated multilateral development banks (MDBs) that fulfil a set of criteria established by the Committee.32 27 See paragraphs 53 and 55 of the Basel II framework. 28 This is to say that the bank would also have corresponding liabilities denominated in the domestic currency. The lower risk weight may also be extended to the risk-weighting of collateral and guarantees. 29 See paragraph 54 of the Basel II framework. 30 For a sample of 142 internationally active banks, as at end-June 2016. 31 See paragraphs 57–58 of the Basel II framework. 32 See paragraphs 56 and 59 of the Basel II framework. 20 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures When calculating the degree of credit risk mitigation (CRM) provided by collateralised transactions, supervisors may choose, under certain conditions, to apply a haircut of zero for repo-style transactions where the counterparty is a core market participant.33 IRB approach for credit risk Under the IRB approach, sovereign exposures are generally treated in a similar manner to exposures against corporates and banks. However, banks’ estimates of the probability of default (PD) of sovereign exposures are not subject to the 0.03% floor, which applies to all other asset classes.34 On average, banks’ risk weights for central government exposures (including both domestic and foreign-currency exposures) under the internal ratings-based approach are currently about 6.5%.35 Market risk framework The revised market risk framework includes a standardised approach and an internal models approach. The standardised approach capital requirement is the sum of three components: the default risk charge, the risk charges under the sensitivities-based method and the residual risk add-on charge. At national discretion, claims on sovereigns, PSEs and MDBs may be subject to a zero default risk weight. A preferential treatment is not applied for sovereign exposures when calculating the credit spread risk and general interest rate risk charges. Under the internal models approach, banks are required to include trading book sovereign exposures as part of their models. This includes default risk models.36 Large exposures framework Under the large exposures framework, banks’ exposures to sovereigns and central banks are exempted. This exemption also applies to PSEs treated as sovereigns according to the risk-weighted capital framework. Any portion of an exposure guaranteed by, or secured by financial instruments issued by, sovereigns are similarly excluded from the framework to the extent that the eligibility criteria for credit risk mitigation recognition are met.37 Leverage ratio framework Consistent with its nature, the leverage ratio includes all balance sheet assets in the exposure measure, including sovereign exposures.38 As set out in the Committee’s finalised Basel III standard, at national discretion, and to facilitate the implementation of monetary policies, a jurisdiction may temporarily exempt central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure in exceptional macroeconomic circumstances. To maintain the same level of resilience provided by the leverage ratio, a jurisdiction applying this discretion must also increase the calibration of the minimum leverage ratio requirement 33 See paragraph 170 of the Basel II framework. 34 See paragraph 285 of the Basel II framework. 35 For a sample of 142 internationally active banks, as at end-June 2016. 36 See paragraph 186(c) of the revised market risk framework. 37 See paragraph 61 of the large exposures framework. 38 See paragraph 15 of the leverage ratio framework. The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 21 commensurately to offset the impact of exempting central bank reserves. The role of the leverage ratio in mitigating sovereign risk depends on how far it is the constraining capital metric for banks. Liquidity standards The liquidity standards – comprising the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) – ensure that a bank has a stable funding profile relative to the liquidity of its assets and an adequate stock of HQLA to meet a short-term liquidity stress event. The stock of eligible HQLA consists of “Level 1” and “Level 2” assets. Level 1 assets consist of a range of sovereign securities and exposures.39 Level 2 assets can also include some sovereign securities in addition to other asset classes.40 While Level 2 assets are subject to haircuts and can comprise no more than 40% of the overall HQLA stock, no haircuts or restrictions are applied to Level 1 assets, as their liquidity-generating capacity would remain intact even in periods of severe idiosyncratic and market stress. In addition, while banks are required to diversify their HQLA within asset classes, this does not apply to the sovereign debt of the bank’s home jurisdiction or the jurisdiction in which the bank operates, central bank reserves and debt securities and cash.41 Pillar 2 While the current Pillar 2 framework does not include specific guidance related to sovereign risk, it requires banks and supervisors to focus on specific types of risks (as part of the broader supervisory review process), including interest rate risk in the banking book and credit concentration risk. In addition, the Committee’s Principles for sound stress testing practices and supervision aim to deepen and strengthen banks’ general stress testing practices and supervisory assessment of these practices.42 Pillar 3 The revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework includes some sovereign-specific disclosure requirements.43 For example, the current framework requires banks to disclose their sovereign exposure amounts and risk- weighted assets. Banks using the IRB approach are also required to disclose their average PD, LGD and maturity of their sovereign exposures. Similar requirements apply for sovereign exposures as part of the counterparty credit risk disclosure templates. 39 See paragraph 50 of the LCR framework. 40 See paragraph 52 of the LCR. 41 See paragraph 44 of the LCR. 42 Available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs155.pdf. 43 Available at www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d309.pdf. http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d309.pdf 22 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Chapter 5: Potential ideas related to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Following the above review of the existing regulatory treatment, this chapter discusses some ideas related to revising the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. Table 5 summarises the ideas related to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures that have been discussed as part of the Committee’s review. They comprise the complete removal of the IRB approach for sovereign exposures, positive standardised risk weights for most sovereign exposures (and therefore the removal of the existing national discretion to set a preferential risk weight for sovereign exposures denominated and funded in the domestic currency of the issuer), the introduction of marginal risk weight add-ons to mitigate concentration risk, and the removal of the national discretion to apply a haircut of zero for sovereign repo-style transactions. The Committee also discussed ideas related to introducing specific Pillar 2 guidance on monitoring, stress testing and responding to sovereign risk, and specific Pillar 3 disclosure requirements related to sovereign exposures.

The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 23 Definition of sovereign entities As noted in Chapter 4, the current regulatory framework applies a somewhat open-ended definition of sovereign exposures. For example, the current Basel II standardised approach for credit risk refers to claims on “sovereigns”, “central banks”, and “non-central government public sector entities (PSEs)” in a relatively high-level manner. Exposures to sovereigns and central banks receive a distinct treatment. In some cases, exposures to non-central government PSEs can be treated as an exposure to the sovereign instead of as a bank exposure. The existing definition of sovereign exposures seeks to reflect differences in legal and institutional arrangements between different jurisdictions. But it can also result in varying degrees of interpretation across banks and jurisdictions, particularly with regard to the scope of non-central government PSEs which are included in the scope of sovereign exposures. These different interpretations have also been highlighted as part of the Committee’s regulatory consistency assessment programme related to the consistent implementation of the Basel framework. To provide additional definitional clarity and consistency in implementation, the Committee discussed the idea of specifying further the definitions of different sovereign entities and the conditions under which non-central government entities could be treated as central government entities for the purpose of the regulatory framework. More specifically, the Committee discussed the idea of defining the set of sovereign entities as follows: (i) Exposures to a central bank are defined as exposures to an entity which is responsible for overseeing and/or implementing the monetary policy of a state or a group of states.44 (ii) Exposures to a central government are defined as exposures to a government of a state which has the power to raise taxes, borrow money and issue currency by means of a central bank, either of that state or of a currency union to which that state belongs. It possesses autonomous powers that allow it to generate sufficient revenues from the economic output and resources of the jurisdiction. These powers, in turn, support the central government’s ability to service its financial obligations. Any constraints on the central government’s powers are self-imposed through treaties or other legal agreements, and cannot be unilaterally altered by another party. States governed by a central government are mutually exclusive, which means that each state can only be represented by one central government. (iii) Exposures to other sovereign entities are defined as exposures to one of the following entities: • a subnational government, defined as a government of a geographically defined part of a state and which has powers to raise taxes and borrow money. It possesses delegated autonomous powers that allow it to generate sufficient revenues from the economic output and resources of its area. These powers, in turn, support the subnational government’s ability to service its financial obligations; • a public sector entity, defined as an organisation that is: (i) created by a central or subnational government; (ii) owned in full or in part by a central or subnational government, or carries out functions of the government under law; (iii) supported by a central or subnational government; and (iv) is accountable to a government. Provided that these criteria are met, PSEs may include commercial and non-commercial undertakings and administrative bodies. Banks could treat exposures to bank PSEs as exposures to PSEs and not as exposures to banks. 44 This includes the European Central Bank and the central banks of the euro area jurisdictions. 24 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures In addition, the Committee discussed the idea of defining domestic-currency sovereign exposures as exposures to a sovereign entity (as defined above) which are denominated and funded in the currency of the sovereign entity. Exposures which do not meet this requirement would be defined as foreign-currency sovereign exposures. In considering the role of currency denomination in the treatment of sovereign exposures, the Committee discussed the idea that sovereign exposures denominated in a currency other than that of the sovereign in question are relatively riskier than those that are denominated in the sovereign’s own currency. Central government exposures denominated in the currency of the sovereign also tend to play an important role in financial markets. Historically, the requirement to fund domestic-currency sovereign exposures in the same currency as the exposure in order to qualify for a preferential risk weight was aimed at mitigating foreign exchange risk. In practice, the Committee noted that funding sources are somewhat fungible and not necessarily linked to specific assets. The Committee also discussed whether the market risk framework adequately capitalises foreign exchange risks, even when they arise from banking book exposures. The Committee noted that there may be holistic considerations that could justify a different risk-weighted treatment for sovereign exposures that are both denominated and funded in the currency of the issuer. Under this definition of sovereign entities, supervisors would be allowed to treat banks’ exposures to other sovereign entities as exposures to a central government if either the risk equivalence criteria A or B below are met: Criteria A: autonomy criteria (for subnational governments only) Both of the following criteria would need to be fulfilled: (i) the other sovereign entity has legislative or constitutional significance within the state, and possesses legislative or constitutional powers to support its autonomous ability to generate sufficient taxes and revenue solely from the economic output and resources of the subnational government to meet its financial obligations, and mitigate the probability of default. This can include independent powers to levy taxes and increase revenue, expropriate property or generate revenue from its priority claim on national wealth; and (ii) the powers of the other sovereign entity are independent of other levels of government: there must be a clear delegation of these powers enshrined in legislative or constitutional arrangements. Other levels of government must not be able to unilaterally impair or take away these delegated powers, subject to the law or constitutional arrangements of its central government. Criteria B: support criteria (for subnational governments and PSEs) Supervisors may allow banks to treat exposures to other sovereign entities as exposures to a central or autonomous subnational government if there are sufficient legislative, constitutional or other arrangements to facilitate the transfer of financial resources or other means directly from a particular central or autonomous subnational government to the other sovereign entity. These arrangements must be sufficient to ensure that the other sovereign entity has a revenue stream that allows it to meet its financial obligations and mitigate the probability of default. Such arrangements could take the form of full, irrevocable and unconditional support directly from that central or autonomous subnational government. Q3. What are your views on the ideas set out above related to the definition of sovereign exposures? Q4. Do you agree that the definition of domestic sovereign exposures should be based on both the currency denomination of the exposure and the currency denomination of the funding? How would such a definition be operationalised in practice? The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 25 Q5. Do you agree with the potential relative rank ordering of different sovereign entities and with the principle of a potential risk equivalence criterion for treating certain non-central government exposures as central government exposures? Do you have any comments on the criterion? Removal of the IRB approach for sovereign exposures The Committee’s recently-finalised Basel III reforms were the result of a strategic review by the Committee of the risk-weighted capital framework and the extent to which it strikes the right balance in terms of simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity. The Committee’s analysis, coupled with the views of a wide range of stakeholders, highlighted concerns with the extent to which certain asset classes can be modelled robustly enough for the calculation of regulatory capital requirements. These asset classes share similar characteristics, including insufficient data for the estimation of key risk inputs (eg PD and LGD), a lack of information possessed by banks, insufficient comparative advantage in assessing the risk of such asset classes, and/or the lack of robust and generally accepted and validated modelling techniques. In 2016 the Committee consulted on the treatment of some of these asset classes, and noted that the Committee was continuing its review of the treatment of sovereign exposures.45 The Committee discussed possible concerns about the ability for banks to robustly model risk parameters for sovereign exposures. To align the treatment of sovereign exposures with other low-default portfolios, it discussed the idea of removing the IRB approach for sovereign exposures. As discussed in Chapter 2 of this paper, there have been instances of sovereign defaults. But the frequency of such defaults relative to other asset classes may make it difficult to prudently model risk parameters. The Committee discussed the idea that, if the IRB approach is removed completely for sovereign exposures, all banks would have to apply a suitable alternative standardised approach. In assessing the merits of the removal of the IRB approach for sovereign exposures, the Committee noted that an important consideration would be the impact this would have on current capital requirements for sovereign exposures. The Committee also discussed an alternative idea of removing only the advanced IRB approach and retaining the foundation IRB approach for sovereign exposures. Q6. Do you agree that capital requirements for sovereign exposures cannot be modelled robustly, and that such exposures should be subject to a standardised approach treatment as a result? Standardised approach treatment for sovereign exposures The Committee discussed ideas for revising the existing standardised approach treatment for banks’ sovereign exposures. A revised approach would be used by all banks when calculating their capital requirements for sovereign exposures held in both the banking book and the trading book (the latter as part of the default risk charge component for sovereign exposures under the standardised approach of the revised market risk framework). The discussions on these ideas sought to balance prudential risk considerations – most notably, the fact that sovereign exposures entail risks (as discussed in Chapter 2) – with other holistic considerations. Accordingly, the Committee considered the following potential standardised treatments: • Exposures to central banks that are denominated in the domestic currency of the central bank could be subject to a 0% risk weight. In addition, exposures to central banks in jurisdictions where 45 The consultation paper is available at www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d362.pdf. file://msfshome/CBMECOWI$/MyDocuments/Documentum/Temp/www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d362.pdf 26 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures monetary policy tools are centred on the exchange rate would also receive a 0% risk weight. The Committee believes that applying positive risk weights to such exposures could hinder the operationalisation and transmission of monetary policy. • The existing national discretion to apply a lower risk weight for sovereign exposures denominated and funded in the domestic currency of the sovereign entity (see Chapter 4), both in the banking and trading book, would be removed. This would reflect the fact that sovereign exposures entail risks. More generally, the removal of this discretion is consistent with the Committee’s approach to gradually removing national discretions from the capital framework, with a view to enhancing comparability across jurisdictions.46 The Committee also discussed whether central government exposures should receive a differentiated treatment from central bank exposures. • Domestic-currency central government exposures could be subject to lower risk weights than foreign-currency central government exposures. This reflects the Committee’s view that such exposures are relatively less risky and that they play an important role in financial markets (eg for liquidity management purposes). These risk weights could also apply to all exposures to MDBs that are currently subject to a 0% risk weight treatment.47 • Foreign-currency central government exposures could be subject to higher risk weights than domestic-currency central government exposures, but lower than other sovereign exposures for a given credit rating. • Exposures to other sovereign entities which meet the risk equivalence criteria would be treated as exposures to the central government. For an entity which meets the “autonomy” criteria, the risk weight could be determined by the credit rating of that entity. In contrast, for an entity which meets the “support” criteria, the risk weight could be determined by the credit rating of the central government or autonomous sub-national government. Exposures to other sovereign entities which do not meet the equivalence criteria could be treated in a broadly similar manner to bank exposures (consistent with the existing regulatory framework). Table 6 illustrates an example of a potential standardised approach treatment for sovereign exposures. This takes the form of a look-up table, where risk weights for exposures to a particular sovereign entity vary based on the external credit rating of the sovereign entity, or in jurisdictions where the use of external credit ratings in regulation is not permitted, the Country Risk Classification (CRC) score determined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This table would be used to determine sovereign exposures risk weights in the banking book and to determine the default risk charge component for sovereign exposures in the trading book. The calibration of the risk weights in this table are for illustrative purposes. To reduce mechanistic reliance on external credit ratings, the Committee considered two additional measures. First, banks could be required to perform due diligence on their sovereign exposures to ensure that they have appropriately considered all available information regarding the risk profile and characteristics of their sovereign counterparties. Banks would need to demonstrate to their supervisors that their due diligence analyses of sovereign exposures were appropriate. Such analyses could result in the application of a higher risk weight than that determined by the external rating/CRC. Supervisors must ensure that banks have appropriately performed their due diligence analysis, and must take supervisory action where this had not been done. Second, the Committee discussed the role of additional (non-rating) indicators to assess the creditworthiness of sovereign exposures. In principle, such indicators could include macroeconomic 46 See, for example, the Committee’s recent survey on the use of national discretions in the regulatory framework, available at www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d297.pdf. 47 The risk-weighted treatment for exposures to other MDBs is set out in the revised standardised approach for credit risk. http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d297.pdf The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 27 variables, fiscal variables and/or credit aggregates. Such indicators could complement the use of external ratings and banks’ due diligence in determining risk weights for sovereign exposures, and/or could be used as indicators for unrated sovereign exposures, or could replace ratings altogether. Table 6: Example of standardised risk weights for sovereign exposures External rating AAA to A– BBB+ to BBB– Below BBB– and unrated OECD CRC 0–2 3 4–7 and no classification Central bank exposures(a) 0% Domestic-currency central government exposures(b) [0–3]% [4–6]% [7–9]% Foreign-currency central government exposures(c) 10% 50% 100% Other sovereign entities(d) 25% 50% 100% (a) Defined as exposures to central banks denominated and funded in domestic currency and exposures to central banks in jurisdictions where monetary policy is centred on the exchange rate. Other central bank exposures (eg equity exposures to a central bank) should be treated as domestic- or foreign-currency central government exposures, depending on the denomination and funding of the currency. (b) Domestic-currency exposures defined as exposures that are denominated and funded in the currency of the sovereign entity. Includes domestic-currency other sovereign exposures which meet the equivalence criteria (autonomy or support) and international organisations and MDBs that are currently subject to a 0% risk weight. Banks should use the rating of the other sovereign entity if the “autonomy” criteria are met. Banks should use the rating of the central government or autonomous subnational government if the “support” criteria are met. (c) Includes foreign-currency other sovereign exposures which meet the equivalence criteria (autonomy or support). Banks should use the rating of the other sovereign entity if the “autonomy” criteria are met. Banks should use the rating of the central government if the “support” criteria are met. (d) When rated, based on the rating of the sovereign entity or its central government (whichever results in the higher risk weight). This example of a standardised approach treatment for sovereign exposures seeks to balance simplicity with comparability and risk sensitivity, in addition to other holistic considerations. It provides a degree of risk sensitivity and differentiation within a relatively simple look-up table with standardised risk weights. This would facilitate comparability and also recognise that sovereign exposures entail risk, by applying different risk weights across and within different sovereign entities – while retaining the possibility of applying a 0% risk weight for certain sovereign exposures (eg central bank exposures) for holistic considerations. But there are other possible ways to design a standardised approach treatment for sovereign exposures. For instance, a more risk-sensitive approach taking the form of a more granular look-up table (eg more rating buckets). For example, this could be based on the six-bucket taxonomy currently used for sovereign exposures in the standardised approach (Table 4), which could be extended to apply to domestic-currency central government exposures, foreign-currency central government exposures and other sovereign entities. In addition, exposures to “other sovereign entities” could be further broken down to exposures to subnational governments, non-commercial PSEs and commercial PSEs. A differentiation could also be made between exposures to central governments and exposures to sovereign entities that meet the risk equivalence criteria (ie the latter would not receive the same risk weights as the former). Such approaches would have the benefit of allowing for a greater risk differentiation across sovereign entities, but could result in a more complex regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures. Another alternative could take the form of a single flat positive risk weight for all sovereign entities (except for central bank exposures). Such an approach would be simpler and would avoid the use of external credit ratings in determining risk weights. But it would also be less risk-sensitive and would not differentiate the risk of various sovereign entities. More generally, the Committee discussed the interactions between the ideas set out above and other aspects of the regulatory framework. For example, it discussed that certain potential non-substantive changes may be needed to the liquidity standards if they are to be consistent with the ideas set out in this 28 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures discussion paper. For example, the current LCR standard states that Level 1 assets include marketable securities of sovereigns that are (inter alia) assigned a 0% risk weight under the Basel II standardised approach for credit risk. In principle, this criterion would become invalid as a result of the potential revisions in this discussion paper, to the extent that fewer sovereign exposures are assigned a 0% risk weight. In practice, it is not the Committee’s intention to change the existing set of eligible Level 1 sovereign assets, as the current LCR framework already recognises non-0% risk-weighted sovereign or central bank debt securities issued in domestic currencies as Level 1 assets.48 Q7. What are your views about how a standardised approach treatment for sovereign exposures should be designed and calibrated? How should such an approach balance simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity? Are there any holistic considerations which could justify a differentiated treatment across different types of sovereign entities, including the relative treatment of central bank and central government exposures? Q8. What role could specific non-rating indicators play in determining sovereign exposure risk weights in the potential standardised approach? Marginal risk weight add-ons to mitigate concentration risk The current large exposures framework applies a limit of 25% of a bank’s Tier 1 capital to any single counterparty or group of connected counterparties, as noted in Chapter 4. However, sovereign exposures are exempt from this treatment.49 As a result, the existing regulatory framework does not include any explicit standardised measures to mitigate the risks associated with excessive holdings of sovereign exposures. Due to holistic considerations, the Committee discussed whether to continue exempting from the large exposures framework all exposures to central governments, central banks and other sovereign exposures deemed risk-equivalent to central governments. PSEs that are not treated as central government exposures would continue to be subject to the large exposures framework. The Committee also considered an idea to introduce instead a specific treatment to mitigate concentration risk associated with exposures to central governments and connected counterparties. Given the current level of banks’ holdings of sovereign exposures, which in part reflect various roles performed by sovereign exposures in financial markets, there is a case that sovereign exposures should continue to be exempt from the large exposures framework, and alternative approaches to preventing banks from having heavily-concentrated exposures to individual sovereigns considered instead. For instance, the Committee discussed ideas related to the introduction of marginal risk weight add-ons, which would vary based on the amount of a bank’s sovereign exposures relative to its Tier 1 capital. Table 7 describes an example of the marginal risk weight add-on idea discussed by the Committee. The key features include the following: • exposures to central banks that are denominated in the central bank’s domestic currency and exposures to central banks in jurisdictions where monetary policy tools are centred on the exchange rate would not be included when calculating a bank’s sovereign exposures; • as a starting point, each sovereign entity would be treated as a single counterparty. Sovereign entities that met the “support” equivalence criteria set out above would be treated as a group of connected sovereign counterparties, as such support could be the result of the distress of one of 48 See paragraph 50 of the LCR standard. 49 PSEs that are not treated as sovereign exposures are currently subject to the large exposures framework. The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 29 these sovereign entities being transmitted to another of these entities. Sovereign entities that met the “autonomy” equivalence criteria would be treated as standalone entities; • a bank would calculate the sum of all other exposures to a sovereign counterparty or to a group of connected sovereign counterparties (see below) and divide this figure by its Tier 1 capital resources; • the bank would then apply the relevant marginal risk weight add-on(s) set out in Table 7 to its exposures to a counterparty or group of connected sovereign counterparties; and • the scope of the sovereign counterparty/group of connected sovereign counterparties would be based on the definition of sovereign entities and the risk equivalence criteria discussed above. More specifically, a bank would calculate the sum of all of its (domestic- and foreign-currency) exposures to a central government entity and any other sovereign entity which meets the equivalence criteria and would treat these as a group of connected sovereign counterparties. Table 7: Example of marginal risk weight add-on table for sovereign exposures Exposure to group of connected sovereign counterparties (% of Tier 1 capital) < 100% 100–150% 150–200% 200–250% 250–300% >300% Marginal risk weight add-on: 0% 5% 6% 9% 15% 30% Table 8 provides an example of how marginal risk weight add-ons would be calculated in practice. As can be seen, the mechanics of the potential approach is broadly analogous to a marginal tax-rate system. The marginal risk weight add-ons could alternatively be designed as a multiplicative scalar of the risk weight for the sovereign exposure or group of connected counterparties. In such a framework, the sovereign exposure risk weights would depend on both the degree of credit risk and the degree of concentration risk. Table 8: Example of marginal risk weight add-on approach Sovereign exposures Units Scope of sovereign counterparties Sovereign exposures (% of Tier 1) Marginal risk weight add-on Tier 1 capital resources 100 Central government A 120  (120+30)/100 = 150% • 0% for first 100 units • 5% for subsequent 50 units • Effective average risk weight add-on of 1.67% Sovereign A entities meet “support” equivalence criteria 30 Sovereign A entities meet “autonomy” equivalence criteria 150  150/100 = 150% • 0% for first 100 units • 5% for subsequent 50 units • Effective average risk weight add-on of 1.67% Central government B 200  200/100 = 200% • 0% for first 100 units • 5% for next 50 units • 6% for subsequent 50 units • Effective average risk weight add-on of 2.75% 30 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures In discussing the idea of marginal risk weight add-ons, the Committee sought to balance prudential risk considerations and other financial stability considerations in the design and calibration of marginal risk weight add-ons. For example, the illustrative risk weight add-ons in the tables above have been calibrated at a relatively low level but would rise at an increasing rate based on a bank’s sovereign exposures concentration. Such an approach seeks to discourage the build-up of large sovereign holdings that could pose particular concentration risks. In addition, the illustrative initial sovereign exposures concentration threshold is set at 100%, which broadly represents the average requirement for bank’s HQLA holdings to meet the liquidity standards. Holdings of exposures to central governments and connected counterparties below this threshold would not be subject to marginal risk weight add-ons. The illustrative initial threshold seeks to recognise the diverse roles of central government exposures in the financial system, such as meeting liquidity standards and collateral management needs, while also mitigating concentration risk. Q9. What are your views regarding the potential marginal risk weight add-on approach for mitigating sovereign concentration risk? Do you have any views on the potential design, granularity and calibration of such an approach? Credit risk mitigation framework The CRM framework recognises certain techniques to mitigate the credit risk of exposures. For example, exposures may be collateralised or guaranteed by a third party. As noted in the previous chapter, the current CRM framework provides supervisors with the discretion to apply a haircut of zero for repo-style transactions with core market participants under certain conditions. 50 These conditions include a requirement for the collateral to qualify for a 0% risk weight under the standardised approach. Given that the ideas discussed above related to potential revisions to the standardised approach generally apply positive risk weights to sovereign exposures, the Committee discussed the implications of these ideas for the existing CRM discretion for repo-style transactions, which would be mostly redundant. For example, the Committee discussed the idea of removing the existing CRM discretion for repo- style transactions. To the extent that market participants already apply positive haircuts for such transactions, removing the discretion would bring the regulatory framework more into line with market practices. The Committee noted that, if the discretion to apply a 0% haircut were to be removed, banks would be required to apply one of the CRM approaches as set out in the revised standardised approach for credit risk framework for such transactions. Q10. What are current market practices related to haircuts for sovereign repo-style transactions? Do you believe that the current repo-style discretion to apply a haircut of zero should be removed from the credit risk mitigation framework? Example of Pillar 2 guidance The Committee discussed ideas related to specific Pillar 2 guidance on sovereign exposures. This would include guidance on monitoring sovereign risk, stress testing for sovereign risk and supervisory responses to the crystallisation of sovereign risk. As part of these ideas, banks would be required to monitor and stress test their sovereign exposures in a manner that appropriately captures risks associated with 50 See paragraph 170 of the Basel II framework. The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 31 sovereign exposures. The guidance below is an example of an idea to enhance the Pillar 2 treatment of sovereign exposures. Monitoring of sovereign risk Banks could be required to have in place effective internal policies, systems and controls to identify, measure, monitor and control risks arising from their sovereign exposures. Banks could be required to promptly identify possible deteriorations in the risk arising from sovereign exposures so as to manage such risks appropriately. Banks could be required to take necessary action, such as enhancing monitoring, increasing provisions or reducing positions in the sovereign exposures concerned, to the extent that such actions are warranted by the findings of their risk assessment. Banks could be required to review their sovereign exposures for indications of heightened risks of sovereign distress. Banks could be required to maintain a set of sovereign exposure indicators and evaluate, on a regular basis, the sensitivity and reasonableness of key assumptions in their choice of material indicators used for their internal capital assessment. The identification and monitoring of risks arising from banks’ sovereign exposures should be included in the banks’ management information system so as to ensure that the board and senior management are provided with timely and relevant information to proactively manage risks relating to their banks’ sovereign exposures. The monitoring of sovereign risk indicators would help banks to understand the fundamentals underlying the sovereign exposures. A non-exhaustive list of monitoring indicators is provided in Table 9. Banks could be required to ensure that their sovereign risk assessment is not based on a mechanistic reliance on particular indicators and indicator levels, and is overlaid with an understanding of the characteristics associated with particular indicators and the factors driving particular indicator levels, as these may differ across jurisdictions. All pertinent specificities and factors relevant to a jurisdiction should be included in the analysis, where appropriate. Banks may use sovereign credit ratings, reports from analysts and from official sector bodies to supplement their internal credit assessments. Banks could be required to also monitor, assess and mitigate the risks arising from concentrations in their holdings of sovereign exposures. Examples of measures to mitigate risks arising from risk concentrations include enhanced monitoring of higher-risk sovereign exposures and diversification of such holdings, where possible. Table 9: Non-exhaustive list of monitoring indicators of sovereign risk Non-fiscal indicators Examples (i) Market-based metrics: These provide information on credit risks, market risks and liquidity risks arising from sovereign exposures. • Credit ratings • Credit default swap spreads • Bond yields and credit spreads • Price movements and bid-ask spreads of financial instruments or transactions with sovereign debt as exposure or underlying collateral (ii) Market depth: These provide information on the extent to which fragility in the broader functioning of capital markets could exacerbate risks arising from sovereign exposures. Metrics reflecting the size and frequency of trades, such as: • Inventory turnover (eg number of buy and sell transactions involving a financial instrument over a time period) • Inventory velocity (eg average number of days/hours between each buy and sell transaction) (iii) Unconventional trigger events: These provide indications of possible adverse price impact on financial instruments and/or a credit rating downgrade arising from a trigger event, such as Observable correlation between unconventional trigger event(s) and significant change in: • Size and frequency of large trades in sovereign- underlying instruments pre and post-event; 32 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures a major monetary policy announcement or a regulatory policy or supervisory announcement/publication. • Access to funding markets; • Securities warehousing capacity; or • Market-making capacity Fiscal indicators (iv) Economic strength • Economic indicators (eg GDP growth, GDP per capita) (v) Fiscal strength • Fiscal finances (eg budget balance in % GDP, debt in % GDP, revenue in % GDP, current account balance) • Debt profile and sustainability (eg maturity, currency composition, investor base, information from debt sustainability reports) (vi) Institutional strength Effectiveness and predictability of public policy, eg: • Strength of the legal system • Political risk Stress testing for sovereign risk Banks could be required to cover the risks of significant sovereign exposures in their stress tests. Banks could be required to consider simultaneous pressures in credit, market and liquidity risk metrics as part of their broader bank-wide stress tests.51 This would help to inform the banks’ capital and liquidity planning processes. Assumptions incorporated in stress scenarios to incorporate the effects of sovereign risk distress could include: (a) a deterioration of the sovereign’s creditworthiness and its possible default; and (b) a deterioration of liquidity conditions in sovereign debt markets, affecting the prices of traded sovereign debt instruments and transactions with sovereign debt as underlying or collateral (eg repos). Specific examples of stress-testing assumptions and methodology that should be applied by banks and supervisors to sovereign exposures held in both the banking and trading book include: (a) Credit risk/counterparty credit risk • Impact on capital adequacy from downward or upward ratings migration on sovereign exposures, including impact on counterparty credit risk capital charges arising from transactions with sovereign counterparties. • Impact on capital adequacy from adjusting haircut for sovereign debt instruments used as collateral to offset credit risk and counterparty credit risk. • Impact on net income and capital adequacy from increasing impairment provisions on sovereign exposures held in the banking book (including exposures held on an available-for-sale or held- to-maturity basis). 51 This is consistent with Principle 10 of the Committee’s Principles for stress testing, available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs155.pdf. The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 33 (b) Market and liquidity risk indicators • Impact on net trading income and capital adequacy from revaluation of positions based on shocks to sovereign credit spreads as well as changes in yields in other asset classes, driven by risk deterioration in the sovereign and jumps in liquidity premia. This includes the impact of revaluations on positions held in the banking book on an available-for-sale basis. • Impact on capital adequacy from yield shock to a sovereign exposure with spillover effects to correlated exposures in other asset classes. • Impact on ability to meet liquidity regulations due to credit rating migrations in sovereign debt, affecting their qualification as high-quality liquid assets. • Impact on liquidity position based on changes to projected cash flows from sovereign exposures over various time horizons. (c) Funding costs and availability • Impact on funding costs, and hence net income and capital adequacy due to higher interest rates, arising from increase in sovereign bond yields of a sovereign under distress. • Impact on funding availability via securities financing transactions due to higher market haircuts or non-acceptance of sovereign debt as collateral. Supervisory review Supervisors could be required to review the adequacy of the internal control and risk management systems of banks for monitoring and reporting material sovereign exposures. Supervisors could be required to also review the extent of a bank’s sovereign risk exposures and concentrations, and the adequacy of the bank’s internal assessment of capital adequacy for such exposures under Pillar 2. Such assessments should include reviews of a bank’s stress tests. Supervisors could be required to make regular and comprehensive assessments of a bank’s stress-testing programme, covering material risk categories and scenarios. Supervisors could be required to ensure that stress testing forms an integral part of the bank’s overall governance and risk management culture. Board and senior management involvement in setting sovereign stress-testing objectives, defining scenarios, discussing the results of stress tests, assessing potential actions and decision-making are critical in ensuring the appropriate use of stress testing in banks’ risk governance and capital planning. Stress test results should contribute to strategic decision-making and foster internal debate regarding assumptions, such as the cost, risk and speed with which new capital could be raised or positions hedged or sold. Supervisors could be required to review the range of remedial actions envisaged by a bank in response to the results of the stress-testing programme and understand the rationale for potential management decisions. Supervisors should challenge whether such actions would be feasible in a period of stress and whether the institution could realistically carry them out. Supervisors could be required to take action if the risks arising from a bank’s sovereign exposures are not adequately managed by the bank, if material deficiencies in the stress-testing programme are identified, or if the results of stress tests are not adequately taken into consideration in the bank’s decision- making process. Supervisors may exercise judgment and proportionality in their assessment of appropriate supervisory measures, taking into account the heterogeneity of banks’ holdings of sovereign exposures across jurisdictions. Examples of supervisory measures include: • intensifying the monitoring of the bank; • requiring the bank to prepare and implement a satisfactory capital adequacy restoration plan; • requiring further provisions; 34 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures • requiring the bank to review limits and/or reduce exposures; and • requiring the bank to raise the level of capital above minimum Pillar 1 requirements, so as to ensure that it continues to meet minimum capital requirements during a stress period. Q11. Do you have any comments on the potential Pillar 2 guidance on sovereign exposures? Is there a need for additional guidance? Pillar 3 disclosure requirements The Committee recently revised its Pillar 3 disclosure framework to enhance the comparability of banks’ disclosures of risk-weighted assets.52 The Committee noted that this framework would be revised to reflect ongoing revisions to the regulatory framework. In considering the optimal level of disclosure requirements, the Committee is guided by the principles that disclosures should be clear, comprehensive, meaningful to users, consistent over time and comparable across time. The Committee discussed ideas related to additional Pillar 3 disclosure templates related to sovereign exposures. For example, additional disclosures could provide important and relevant information for market participants to better understand and assess the different elements of banks’ sovereign risk. Examples of potential disclosure templates are included in the annex of this discussion paper, for illustrative purposes. These would require banks to disclose their: (i) exposures and risk-weighted assets of different sovereign types by jurisdictional breakdown; (ii) exposures to and risk-weighted assets of different sovereign entities by currency breakdown; and (iii) exposures to sovereign entities by accounting classification. In principle, the disclosure templates could be even more granular in nature. For example, they could require banks to disclose their exposures and risk-weighted assets on a jurisdictional and currency breakdown (ie for a given jurisdiction, a bank would disclose how much sovereign exposures it holds issued in the domestic currency and foreign currency of the jurisdiction). Q12. Do you have any comments on the potential Pillar 3 disclosure requirements for sovereign exposures? Is there a need for additional disclosure requirements? Home-host arrangements The Basel framework applies to all internationally active banks on a fully consolidated basis or at every tier within a group. To mitigate potential concerns related to different prudential treatments under both the standardised and IRB approaches for sovereign exposures applied at the subsidiary and consolidated level of such banks, the Committee encourages home authorities of internationally-active banks to recognise, at the consolidated level, the prudential treatment applied by host authorities for subsidiaries, to the extent that the latter is compliant with the Basel framework. The Committee notes that home authorities retain the option to apply higher risk weights at a consolidated level. 52 The revised Pillar 3 framework is available at www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d309.pdf. http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d309.pdf The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures 35 Q13. Do you agree that home authorities of internationally active banks should be encouraged to recognise the prudential treatment of sovereign exposures applied by host authorities for subsidiaries? Additional ideas The ideas discussed above relate to the risk-weighted treatment of sovereign exposures and the large exposures framework. The Committee has not considered concrete ideas related to revising the leverage ratio framework and liquidity standards, as these have been recently finalised and are in the process of being implemented domestically. The Committee also discussed potential risks with sovereign exposures held in the banking book that are eligible to meet the definition of HQLAs but that are potentially subject to valuation risks that are not currently capitalised. For assets held in the banking book on an available-for-sale basis, changes in valuation are reflected in the balance sheet as well as capital and reserves, although not in the profit and loss account. In contrast, there is no recognition of changes in value for assets held on a held-to-maturity basis unless they are sold or impaired. Thus, as part of future deliberations the Committee will consider the accounting and capital treatment of eligible high-quality liquid assets, including but not limited to sovereign exposures. Q14. Are any further revisions to the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures needed? 36 The regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures Chapter 6: Feedback on the discussion paper The Committee welcomes comments from interested stakeholders – including academics, analysts, debt management agencies, finance ministries, market participants and the general public – on the different elements covered in this discussion paper by 9 March 2018. The purpose of this paper is to elicit comments and feedback from a broad range of interested stakeholders. The Committee particularly welcomes feedback on the following questions: Q1. Are there any additional sources and channels of sovereign risk in the banking system that are relevant to, and that should be captured in, the prudential regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures? Q2. Are there additional roles of sovereign exposures in financial markets and the broader economy that are of relevance to the prudential regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures? Q3. What are your views on the potential definition of sovereign exposures? Q4. Do you agree that the definition of domestic sovereign exposures should be based on both the currency denomination of the exposure and the currency denomination of the funding? How would such a definition be operationalised in practice? Q5. Do you agree with the potential relative rank ordering of different sovereign entities and with the principle of a potential risk equivalence criteria for treating certain non-central government exposures as central government exposures? Do you have any comments on the criteria? Q6. Do you agree that capital requirements for sovereign exposures cannot be modelled robustly, and that such exposures should be subject to a standardised approach treatment as a result? Q7. What are your views about how a standardised approach treatment for sovereign exposures should be designed and calibrated? How should such an approach balance simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity? Are there any holistic considerations which could justify a differentiated treatment across different types of sovereign entities, including the relative treatment of central bank and central government exposures? Q8. What role could specific non-rating indicators play in determining sovereign exposure risk weights in the potential standardised approach? Q9. What are your views regarding the potential marginal risk weight add-on approach for mitigating sovereign concentration risk? Do you have any views on the potential design, granularity and calibration of such an approach? Q10. What are current market practices related to haircuts for sovereign repo-style transactions? Do you believe that the current repo-style discretion to apply a haircut of zero should be removed from the credit risk mitigation framework? Q11. Do you have any comments on the potential Pillar 2 guidance on sovereign exposures? Is there a need for additional guidance? Q12. Do you have any comments on the potential Pillar 3 disclosure requirements for sovereign exposures? Is there a need for additional disclosure requirements? Q13. Do you agree that home authorities of internationally active banks should be encouraged to recognise the prudential treatment of sovereign exposures applied by host authorities for subsidiaries? Q14.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Financial bailouts, stimulus spending, and lower revenues during the Great Recession have resulted in some of the highest public debt ratios seen in advanced economies in the past 40 years. Recent debates have centered on the pace at which to pay down this debt, with few questions being asked about the desirable level of public debt to which the economy should converge following a debt shock. While some countries face debt sustainability constraints that leave them little choice, others are in the more comfortable position of being able to fund themselves at reasonable—even exceptionally low—interest rates. For these countries, there is a very real question of whether to live with high debt while allowing the debt ratio to decline organically through growth, or to pay it down deliberately to reduce the burden of the debt. This paper considers optimal public debt and investment policy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It abstracts from rollover risks faced by countries that are near their debt limits, and also from shorter-run cyclical considerations. It is not that these considerations are unimportant— for they surely are at present in a number of countries. But they are not the dominant factors for countries that are near full employment and enjoy considerable fiscal space (even in some cases despite relatively high levels of public debt, as argued in our earlier IMF Staff Position Note on this topic, Ostry and others [2010]), a set of countries that are also in need of policy advice. Under these conditions, economic theory provides three insights. First, inherited public debt, though accumulated for good reasons, represents a deadweight burden on the economy, dimming both its investment and growth prospects; a corollary is that an economy that has inherited a lot of public debt (for example, because of a financial crisis) will rationally choose to invest less in public capital than one with a lower level of debt. Second, if fiscal space remains ample, policies to deliberately pay down debt are normatively undesirable. The reason is that for such countries, the distortive cost of policies to deliberately pay down the debt is likely to exceed the crisis-insurance benefit from lower debt. In such cases, debt-to-GDP ratios should be reduced organically through growth, or opportunistically when less distortionary sources of revenue are available. Third, public debt should be issued to smooth the taxes necessary to finance lumpy expenditures. This action yields a version of the golden rule whereby public investment is debt-financed and undertaken to the point that social returns equal the market interest rate, with the twist that the social return will itself be reduced by the need to raise distortive taxation on labor and capital to service the higher debt. What constitutes a safe level of debt (or ample fiscal space, as defined in Ostry and others [2010]) is, needless to say, very difficult to pin down precisely in practice, and can never be established through some mechanical rule or threshold. Stress testing public-sector balance sheets is essential to form judgments at the country level of what constitutes a safe public debt level. It may be helpful to think of debt levels as falling into three zones: a green zone, in which fiscal space is ample; a yellow zone, in which space is positive but sovereign risks are salient; and a red zone, in which fiscal space has run out. This paper is concerned with green-zone cases. Reducing debt in such cases is likely to be normatively undesirable as the costs involved will be larger than the resulting benefits. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 2 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND INTRODUCTION High public debt in advanced economies is an important legacy of the global financial crisis, as is an erosion of the public capital stock (although this latter problem started a couple decades ago, and applies to not only several advanced economies, but also many emerging market economies and low-income countries, in which infrastructure bottlenecks and deficiencies are a hindrance to economic development). The first problem points in the direction of reducing public debt, while the second (given that economic theory strongly suggests that investment should be financed by debt rather than taxes) points to increasing it. This latter issue is especially true at the current juncture, given the very low level of real interest rates and the existence of demand shortfalls in a number of advanced economies. Why do we think that high public debt should be reduced? The main rationale is essentially one of risk management, the desire for additional margins to cope with unanticipated or contingent risks. The option value of lower debt is particularly high if there are risks of catastrophic events (an example would be a financial crisis in which a public backstop is essential), in which the government would need to ramp up borrowing massively (the more so given the political and economic limits to raising taxes sharply in a pinch). If debt is high when such a shock occurs, a heavy penalty may be exacted as sovereign risk premiums rise and, in extreme cases, a shutout from markets would ensue. In other words, debt needs to be reduced today to lower the potential risk of a sovereign crisis tomorrow. A second rationale for why high public debt needs to be brought down is the belief that high public debt weighs on economic growth. While causality runs both ways, an important causal channel is taxation: high public debt implies the need to distort economic activity (labor, capital) to service the debt (either through taxation or cuts in productive spending), which dampens economic growth. A reasonable idea is that laying the foundation for sustainable growth requires paying the upfront cost of reducing the debt today. For countries with a demand shortfall and infrastructure gaps, but with high and risky levels of public debt, there is thus an evident tradeoff between building up the public capital stock and containing sovereign risks and laying the foundation for future growth. An exception to the dilemma would be if debt-financed public investment spending actually lowered the debt ratio, as can occur if Keynesian effects are large, the interest burden is minuscule, and investment is super-efficient (the argument is not fundamentally different from the one put forward by supply- siders in the 1980s, that tax cuts would raise GDP and government revenue so much that the debt ratio would fall). While these conditions may be salient in some countries at present, few consider them to constitute a set of neutral assumptions that should guide public policy in general. More likely, the typical case is one in which the ‘lunch’ of a public infrastructure buildup has to be paid for with higher debt, and thus a judgment formed about the weight to attach to the different fiscal objectives in specific cases. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 3 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND This is why debates at present seem focused on what is the greater priority: lowering public debt or building public infrastructure. For countries with low debt and big infrastructure needs (and with idle resources and facing low interest rates), building infrastructure should be the greater priority. For countries with significant risk of fiscal distress, it is unlikely that they could afford to take the chance of going on a borrowing spree, no matter how large the public investment deficiencies. But what about less clear-cut cases? What about countries with high debt, but no plausible risk of fiscal distress, with some infrastructure needs, but that are operating near full employment and normal levels of real interest rates? Perhaps the largest economies are not in this situation today, but these conditions are not far-fetched, and have prevailed for many countries in the past. What policy advice applies to such countries? To get at this issue, one needs an analytical framework that abstracts from the considerations that have tended to drive recent debates: Keynesian demand management and risk of fiscal crisis (conceptually, these can be added back into the model, but we want to focus on a separate set of issues, which have not been explored much to date). Our approach allows one to focus on how public debt, public investment and growth interact in situations in which the economy may be near full employment and there is ample fiscal space (which can occur, as argued in our earlier IMF Staff Position Note, Ostry and others (2010), even if there is substantial public debt—Figure 1).2 Two questions seem especially relevant in such a framework. The first relates to the normative implications of high public debt itself. One implication might be that it should be paid down in a reasonable timeframe (not too fast so as to open up an output gap, for example), not only because of material effects of sovereign risk, but also because the debt itself represents a burden in the classic public finance sense—distortive taxation is needed to service it, undercutting the foundation of future economic growth. A fiscal effort today saves on the fiscal burden in perpetuity, providing a benefit equal to the present value of the smaller distortion. Against this argument is the increase in distortionary taxation today (or during the timeframe of the fiscal effort), which is costly. Does a standard public-finance model yield a prediction of the relative size of the gain and losses? And how does this prediction relate to how to handle the debt shock? A second issue concerns the impact of the debt shock on the warranted level of public investment. Higher debt, as just mentioned, requires higher distortive taxation for servicing. Such taxation is likely to reduce the productivity of labor and capital (factors that are complementary to public capital), meaning that both output and public capital should be lower than in a situation in which there is less public debt. Thus, there are implications of public debt for warranted public investment and, in turn, for the growth path of the economy. 2 The discussion of fiscal space in Ostry and others (2010) has since been adopted by Moody’s in their assessment of fiscal risks in advanced economies. Both analyses highlight the existence of wide gaps (margins of maneuver) between current debt ratios and public debt limits (points at which market access is likely to be curtailed or sharp rises in sovereign borrowing costs take place) in a number of advanced and emerging market economies. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 4 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Figure 1. Fiscal Space: Distance to Debt Limit (percentage points) Source: Moody’s Analytics (estimates as of May 2014, https://www.economy.com/dismal/fiscal-space/default.aspx) based on methodology developed in Ostry and others (2010) and Ghosh and others (2013). Note: Fiscal space is defined as the difference between the debt limit and the actual debt-to-GDP ratio. Our benchmark setup is a closed-economy representative-agent model of domestic debt, so we abstract from inter- and intragenerational distribution issues, as well as the international transfer problem.3 The only purpose of public debt is to shift intertemporally the costs associated with distortionary. Despite the abstraction of the formal framework—or perhaps because of it—we are able to draw several clear policy-relevant insights. 3 In an open economy, paying down external debt involves a costly transfer of resources abroad, so the closed- economy assumption actually stacks the argument against “living with the debt.” Note that, since the analysis here pertains solely to sovereigns that are firmly in the “green zone” of ample fiscal space, crisis risk is ruled out regardless of whether the economy is open or closed: inasmuch as the government may be less willing to make an extraordinary fiscal effort to honor its debt if held by foreigners rather than domestic residents, the size of the green zone could conceivably be narrower in the open economy context. As to tax incidence, in an open economy in which capital is mobile, it would be very difficult to tax that capital, but this is economically very similar to the closed-economy case in which the optimal capital tax rate falls to zero after the initial period (as in Chamley [1986]). Essentially, in the closed economy, capital is intertemporally mobile (investment will not materialize if capital is taxed), while in the open economy, it is mobile across borders, with the same result (it is very difficult to tax). Thus, we do not see sharply different messages as far as tax incidence is concerned.

Although the debt may have been incurred for good reasons, for a given stock of public capital, the higher the inherited debt, the poorer the economy (by the present value of the distortionary costs of the taxation needed to service the debt). Efficiency dictates that the larger the inherited debt, and thus the higher the level of taxation, the lower will be both public and private investment, and the lower will be output growth. Higher-debt economies will rationally invest less in public infrastructure than less-indebted economies.  Where countries retain ample fiscal space, governments should not pursue policies aimed at paying down the debt, instead allowing the debt ratio to decline through growth and “opportunistic” revenues, living with the debt otherwise. The reason is that the deadweight loss associated with inherited public debt represents a sunk cost— so, abstracting from rollover risk, there is little purpose in paying it down by raising taxes or cutting productive government spending (of course if there is scope to cut unproductive spending this should be pursued). Distorting your economy to deliberately pay down the debt only adds to the burden of the debt, rather than reducing it. When fiscal space is limited, incurring this cost is likely to be normatively desirable given the crisis-insurance benefit. When space is ample—which cannot be established through some mechanical rule but will generally require judgments based on stress testing fiscal balance sheets to withstand extreme shocks—the distortive cost of paying down the debt is likely to exceed the crisis-insurance benefit.  Debt should be used to smooth the taxes necessary to finance lumpy government expenditures. For public investment, this implies debt-financing of projects whose social marginal product earns at least the market interest rate. The twist on the standard “golden rule” is recognizing that the additional debt incurred will need to be serviced with distortionary taxation of factors (labor, capital) that may be complementary to public capital, thereby reducing the return to the public investment. Thus, the social rate of return will need to be higher as the public debt increases: while the quantitative impact on the required rate of return is likely to be small (in the order of a few basis points), the cumulative effect on the long-run stock of public (and private) capital will not be negligible. For plausible parameters, an increase in public debt of 50 percent of GDP (roughly the order of magnitude experienced by many advanced economies since 2007) would lower steady-state output and consumption by 2 percentage points in perpetuity (implying a present value welfare loss of 30 percent of initial consumption), with a similar decline in long-run levels of private and public capital. It is a feature of the framework adopted here that higher public debt leads to lower investment, slower transitional growth, and a lower long-run level of output: debt is bad for growth. Despite the clear causality, it does not follow that once the debt has been accumulated, it should be paid down to restore growth. On the contrary, where countries retain ample fiscal space, the cure WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 6 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND would seem to be worse than the disease—the taxation needed to pay down the debt will be more harmful to growth than living with the debt, and the reduction in sovereign risk that would ensue is likely to be smaller than the distortive cost involved in paying down the debt. PUBLIC FINANCES AND GROWTH IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES: A SNAPSHOT The global financial crisis has resulted in sharp increases in advanced-economy public debt ratios, on a scale unprecedented in peace time. On average, debt rose from 53 percent of GDP at end-2007 to almost 80 percent by end-2012, while for the top quartile, debt now exceeds 100 percent of GDP (Figure 2, top panel). Corresponding to this increase were below-the-line operations (mainly financial-sector restructuring costs) together with marked deteriorations in primary balances, which swung from an average surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of 4.4 percent in 2009, before recovering partially by 2012 (Figure 2, middle panel). In turn, the deterioration in primary balances corresponded mainly to the loss of revenues and the operation of automatic stabilizers during the Great Recession; very little represented discretionary stimulus, and of that, only a small fraction was investment in public infrastructure. Thus, while the accumulation of public debt was generally for good reasons (averting an economic or banking system collapse), the fact remains that most advanced economies have built up large stocks of debt but have little or no more public infrastructure to show for it. Along with the deterioration of the public finances came the collapse of output growth. Real GDP growth in advanced economies turned sharply negative in 2009, rebounded somewhat in 2010, and has remained moderate thereafter. Across countries, many different factors were at play in the initial growth collapse, which certainly cannot be attributed to the rise in public debt (the causality was almost surely the other way around). But longer term, it becomes more plausible that the rise in public debt may have effects on investment and growth. It is noteworthy, for instance, that projections for 2017—a full decade after the onset of the crisis—suggest that advanced economies will have barely half their precrisis growth rates, and projected growth for 2013–17 is strongly negatively correlated with end-2012 public debt ratios (the correlation is – .41, and statistically significant at the 5 percent level). These developments raise important policy questions: will the rise in public debt dim investment and growth prospects? If so, should governments seek to pay down their debt as soon as possible? Or should they embark upon ambitious public infrastructure programs to help restore growth, taking advantage of low interest rates? Answering such questions requires a formal framework based on public finance theory, to which we now turn. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 7 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Figure 1.

In such a setup, public borrowing does not relax the economy’s flow resource constraint, and public spending necessarily crowds out private spending. The purpose of public debt is to shift the burden of taxation over time so as to reduce its total distortive cost. Optimal Fiscal Policy A formal model with these features is presented in Box 1. The representative agent chooses how much to consume and to work, as well as investment in physical capital and government bonds. The first-order conditions characterizing behavior are standard, and imply that labor supply will depend on the after-tax wage; the demand for government bonds will be a function of the interest rate; and private investment will depend on the after-tax return on capital. The government must decide how much to invest in public capital, how much of the public consumption good to provide, what taxes to levy on wages and on the return to private capital, and residually, how much to borrow (Box 2). Public debt is in the form of one-period bonds and there is no possibility of default. The government is benevolent in the sense that it chooses its fiscal policy to maximize the representative agent’s lifetime utility, subject to the economywide resource constraint, its own budget constraint, and a “feasibility constraint.” The latter summarizes the agent’s endogenous response to taxation and its intertemporal budget constraint. For instance, if the government taxes wages more heavily, labor supply will be reduced, and this needs to be taken into account in the government’s optimization problem. If non-distorting taxes were available, the feasibility constraint would never bind. The first-order conditions characterizing optimal fiscal policy are analogous to those of the representative agent, except that private marginal utilities and rates of substitution get replaced by their corresponding social quantities. The latter differ from the private counterparts because of the feasibility constraint (that is, because only distortionary taxes are available). Thus the public consumption good should be provided to the point that its marginal utility equals the social marginal cost of its provision, and public investment should be undertaken to the point 4 In practice, of course, it makes a great deal of difference who is the “we” and who is the “ourselves.” The assumption that debt is held by domestic residents is plausible for advanced economies where, on average, more than two-thirds of public debt is held by residents (ranging from about 30 percent in France and Germany to 70 percent in the United Kingdom and the United States, and more than 90 percent in the advanced economy with the highest debt ratio, Japan). On the transfer problem, see Keynes (1929). WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 9 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND that the marginal product of public capital equals the social marginal rate of substitution across periods. Taxes on labor and capital should be chosen such that the marginal disutility of work is equal to the marginal social value of producing more output, and the marginal product of private capital is equal to the social marginal rate of substitution across periods. Although social marginal utilities and rates of substitution differ from the private quantities because taxes are distortionary, a key result that emerges from the formal optimization problem is that the government’s implied discount rate will equal the market interest rate. (In essence, the wedge between private and social valuations is constant over time, and therefore does not affect the discount rate.5) As discussed next, this has important implications for optimal debt policy. An illustrative baseline scenario is depicted in Figure 3 (solid line) where, for ease of exposition, it is convenient to start with a case where there is no taxation of private capital. Starting from a low level of public capital, the government invests, raising output and consumption of both the private and public goods until the steady state is reached.6 The economy thus follows a standard neoclassical growth pattern. (It would be straightforward to add exogenous technical change, in which case the economy would be constantly converging on a shifting rather than a unique steady state, but this is inessential to the analysis here.) Turning to public debt dynamics, there is a sharp initial increase in debt (especially when the starting level of debt is high, dashed lines), followed by more steady increases along the optimal path. Since the distortionary costs of taxation are convex (that is, increasing at an increasing rate) in the tax rate, minimizing the total distortionary cost involves smoothing tax rates over time. The reason debt is issued here is thus two-fold: first, public investment tapers off over time, implying a declining path of investment expenditure; second, growth of the economy implies a larger tax base (wage income). Both effects mean that it is optimal to defer payment for government expenditure by issuing public debt. Indeed, it can be shown that a “golden rule” obtains whereby there is an approximate one-to-one correspondence between public investment and cumulative primary deficits. Thus public investment is largely debt financed, and undertaken to the point that its marginal product is equal to the market interest rate on public debt. This is the standard “golden rule” for public investment, although it bears emphasizing that the debt will need to be serviced using distortionary taxation on factors complementary to public capital (for example, labor, private capital), thus reducing the marginal product of public capital. While the quantitative impact on the required social rate of return is likely to be small, the cumulative effect on the stock of public capital is non-negligible at higher values of inherited debt. 5 This result, originally due to Chamley (1986) for the long-run and to Chari, Christiano, and Kehoe (1994) in the short run for a CES (constant elasticity of substitution) utility function, is akin to Little and Mirrlees’ (1974) argument that, even in countries with highly distorted capital markets, world interest rates can be used for discounting returns in project evaluation. 6 Output declines slightly as the steady state is approached because leisure is a normal good, so the representative agent works less as the economy becomes richer. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 10 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND A Debt Shock With these preliminaries, we can turn to our question of interest: what happens if there is an exogenous increase in public debt? (The increase is exogenous in the sense that it does not correspond to higher public investment or provision of the public good, but rather results from some extraneous event, such as the fallout from a financial crisis.) Conceptually, there are three possibilities. Optimal policy could involve paying down the debt immediately so that, following the initial period, the debt path returns to the baseline scenario; or it could involve paying down debt more gradually, so there is gradual convergence to the baseline scenario; or the economy could simply live with the higher debt forever. A priori, it is far from clear which will obtain. On the one hand, paying down the debt quickly involves high rates of taxation and correspondingly large distortionary costs; on the other hand, never paying it down means servicing it forever, thus incurring the distortionary costs of taxation in perpetuity. To see which is optimal, the model outlined in Box 1 is solved numerically, and the effect of an initial debt shock simulated. It turns out that the optimal policy involves living with the debt forever, so the new path of debt is essentially “parallel” to the baseline path (Figure 3). To understand why, recall the key result from the optimization problem that despite private and social valuations being different, the government’s discount rate will equal the market interest rate. Suppose, in any period, the government is considering paying down $1 of public debt. If it does so today, it incurs the distortionary costs of raising another dollar of revenue. If it defers repayment to tomorrow, the debt will have grown by the market interest rate, (1+r), and the cost will be the distortion associated raising an additional $(1+r). But the government discounts the future at precisely the market interest rate, so it gains nothing by paying down a dollar of debt today.7 Since the same argument can be applied to any period, the government will just live with the original inherited debt. In fact, applying Robert Barro’s (1979) tax-smoothing argument, it can be shown that taxes will be set so as to achieve a constant distortionary cost; once the steady state is achieved, this will imply constant tax rates and revenues, the latter equal to the interest payments on the debt (if taxes were set any higher, debt would decline, so eventually taxes would decline, violating the tax-smoothing principle; if set any lower, debt would grow explosively, eventually requiring higher taxes, which again would violate the tax-smoothing principle). 7 In this simple heuristic explanation, the interest rate is treated as constant; in the actual optimization in Box 2, the government takes into account the endogeneity of the interest rate to the private sector’s saving decision and its own fiscal policies. Since there is no possibility of default here, there is no risk premium. In a fuller model, the government would also need to consider that, as debt rises and the debt limit is approached, so will the risk premium; the government would in this fuller setup take this into account in solving for its optimal fiscal program (consumption, investment, borrowing, taxation). The theoretical analysis in Ostry and others (2010) and Ghosh and others (2013) suggests that the risk premium only rises appreciably close to the debt limit, and the empirical analysis in Acharya, Drechsler, and Schnabl (2014) implies only modest increases in the risk premium with higher debt. Since the analysis in this paper is solely for countries with ample fiscal space, these considerations are not incorporated here. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 11 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND Even though it is optimal for the government to live with the debt, this inherited debt is not without its (negative) consequences. An economy that inherits a stock of public debt is “poorer” by the present value of the distortions associated with raising the revenue to service that debt. Higher initial debt requires higher taxation to service it. Higher tax rates lower labor supply, reducing the marginal product of (private and public) capital, with correspondingly lower investment and output. Since the two economies in the simulations start at the same level of output, average growth in the economy with higher initial debt must be lower than average growth in the low-debt economy. Debt is thus bad for growth here, with the causality running from higher debt leading to lower growth via the higher taxation required to service it. Figure 3.

To put the magnitudes in perspective, the simulation assumes that initial debt is some 50 percent of GDP higher than in the baseline (that is, 100 percent of GDP rather than 50 percent of GDP). As a result, in the steady state, consumption, output, the capital stock, and investment are about 2 percentage points lower permanently compared to the counter factual. At reasonable discount rates, the present value welfare cost of inheriting 50 percent of GDP higher debt is about 30 percent of the initial period consumption. Paying Down the Debt The analytical framework implies that it is better to live with high debt than to pay it down. In part, however, this is because the model does not incorporate rollover risk. In reality, there is a trade-off: paying down the debt may be costly, but doing so lowers the likelihood of a funding crisis. In undertaking the cost-benefit calculus, a first question is how much more costly would it be to pay down the inherited debt than to live with it? For plausible parameters, paying down 5 percent of GDP (that is, one-tenth of the additional inherited debt8) in one year incurs a present value welfare cost equal to about 1 percent of GDP.9 But these costs are highly non- linear: paying down 10 percent of GDP of the debt would imply a welfare cost equal to 2–3 percent of GDP, and paying down 20 percent of GDP would incur a cost of at least 6 percent of GDP. What about the benefit? This is very dependent on the level of the debt and the distance to the sovereign’s debt limit—that is, the available fiscal space (as defined in our earlier IMF Staff Position Note on fiscal space, Ostry and others [2010]). If fiscal space is ample, the benefit in terms of lowering the probability of crisis by reducing debt is likely to be small. Of course, in reality, assessing when fiscal space is ample (as Moody’s have done for the countries in the green zone of Figure 1—based on the methodology of Ostry and others [2010]) is not a mechanical exercise. In particular, assessing whether pernicious nonlinearities may begin to take hold requires detailed stress testing of public sector balance sheets and judgments about economic resilience in the face of extreme shocks. It may thus be helpful to think in terms of countries falling broadly into three zones: a green zone in which fiscal space is ample and the potential for a sovereign crisis negligible; a yellow zone in which space is positive and perhaps even sizable but where, especially given the likelihood that markets may give little warning of a debt limit (as shown in Ostry and others [2010] and Ghosh and others [2013]), sovereign risks are salient; and a red zone, in which fiscal space has run out. As debt rises, moreover, countries may transition across zones, and the cost-benefit calculus of whether to pay down the debt or not will evolve, 8 Paying down less incurs a smaller cost, but of course would contribute to correspondingly smaller crisis- reduction benefits. 9 Of course, if we were thinking in terms of an open economy and external debt, the welfare cost of paying down 5 percent of GDP in external debt would be this distortionary cost (1 percent of GDP) plus the 5 percent transferred to foreigners (so 6 percent). The cost of paying down the debt would thus be much larger in an open- economy setting than in the one here. In that sense, the closed-economy setting actually stacks the argument against living with the debt (since the cost of repaying the debt is much lower in the closed-economy setting). WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 13 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND particularly as the risk premium and borrowing costs begin to rise through the yellow zone. The model in this paper pertains to countries in the green zone, but the practical application would factor in where countries lie along the fiscal space continuum. Empirically, it is difficult to pin down the probability of a crisis—let alone how much that probability falls as debt declines—because sovereign debt crises in advanced economies are rare. A recent database (Baldacci and others [2011]) of negative fiscal “events” (sovereign default, debt restructuring, spike in spreads, or high inflation), however, can help. For an advanced economy with 120 percent of GDP of debt, the likelihood of a negative event is estimated to be about 2.6 percent per year: over a 20 year horizon, the expected number of crises is 0.52, with a very generous estimate of the output cost associated with these events (most of which are not a full blown sovereign debt crisis) being approximately 15 percent of GDP.10 At debt of 120 percent of GDP, therefore, the expected loss is 7.8 percent of GDP. Suppose debt is lowered to 100 percent of GDP. The corresponding likelihood of an event is 2.4 percent per year, yielding an expected loss of 7.2 percent of GDP.11 In other words, the expected benefit of reducing debt from 120 percent of GDP to 100 percent of GDP is only about 0.4–0.6 percent of GDP—or around one- tenth of the welfare cost due to distortionary taxation.12 The calculation above is very much predicated on the sovereign being sufficiently far from its debt limit (that is, having ample fiscal space). Obviously, at or very near the debt limit (in the yellow zone, but close to the red zone threshold), there will be enormous gain from reducing debt before a crisis occurs. Thus the conclusion is not that it is never worth reducing debt in order to lower the likelihood of crisis. Indeed, with the precise location of the debt limit uncertain, there is insurance value in keeping fiscal space against the possibility of future shocks that increase the sovereign’s debt (this would apply to countries in the yellow zone). But for countries that have ample fiscal space (clearly in the green zone), the benefit of reducing debt 10 The output cost is calculated as the undiscounted sum over the three years subsequent to the event of the difference between actual and precrisis trend GDP. This estimate is in line with other studies—for example, Sturzenegger (2004); Borensztein and Panizza (2008); Levy-Yeyati and Panizza (2011), although a few papers—for example, Furceri and Zdzienicka (2011); De Paoli, Hoggarth, and Saparta (2009) suggest a permanently lower GDP level and thus larger costs. 11 An alternative approach to estimating the likelihood of crisis is to use the probability implied by market spreads. Simple regressions of government bond yields on debt (with country-fixed effects and time effects) for a panel of advanced economies suggests that an increase in debt of 10 percent of GDP would be associated with 20 basis point higher spreads, so reducing debt from 120 percent of GDP to 100 percent of GDP would be associated with 0.4 percentage points lower spreads. Acharya, Drechsler, and Schnabl (2014) obtain very similar estimates: in their study, 20 percent of GDP higher debt would be associated with 40 basis points higher CDS (credit default swap) spreads. 12 A slightly different way of calculating the benefit (in terms of reducing the expected cost of crises) of lower debt is to consider the probability that at least one crisis occurs over the planning horizon (say, 20 years). At debt of 120 percent of GDP, this probability is 41 percent ( 100 (1 (1 0.026) ^ 20))    , whereas at 100 percent of GDP, the corresponding probability is 38.5 percent; again, therefore, the estimated benefit is small (0.37 percent of GDP ( 100 ((0.41 0.38) 0.15)).    WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 14 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (by deliberately running overall surpluses) is unlikely to exceed the cost of the necessary distortionary taxation. In such cases, debt-to-GDP ratios should be reduced organically, through output growth, or opportunistically, when less distortionary sources of revenue such as privatization receipts or royalties are available. Within the confines of the formal model, there are two such sources of short-run inelastic revenue: income from initial holdings of public debt and income from the initial stock of private capital. Both of these sources will be inelastic in the short run, but highly elastic in the longer run (because agents can choose to save less in the form of government bonds or private capital when they expect the income to be taxed heavily). Since there is no explicit tax on the income from government bonds here, the “taxation” takes the form of very low—perhaps negative—real interest rates in the initial period. In a monetary model with sticky prices, this could be achieved by cutting nominal interest rates—as indeed has been the case in advanced economies since the global financial crisis where policy rates have been at historic lows and have even flirted with the zero-bound. Within the confines of the “real” model presented here, low real interest rates must be engineered by cutting taxes on the more elastic tax base (labor), giving a fillip to output and consumption in the initial period, and thus reducing the rate of return payable on the inherited debt.13 A similar phenomenon occurs when there is the possibility of taxing capital income. In the initial periods, when the capital stock is fixed (that is, before it depreciates), capital income is inelastic and its taxation largely non-distortionary. Accordingly, the optimal fiscal program calls for heavy taxation to reduce public debt. Very quickly, however, the private capital stock becomes highly elastic (the anticipation of taxation will lead to lower investment) and the optimal tax rate on capital falls to zero.14 In an economy with an initially inelastic source of revenue, the government should opportunistically pay down some of the inherited debt; the greater the inherited debt, the larger the amount paid down through such taxation. STYLIZED FACTS Since the analytical framework used here is largely normative, it cannot be formally tested against statistical evidence. Nevertheless, it may be interesting to examine the extent to which countries have been following the framework’s prescriptions, and whether some its implications hold empirically. This section summarizes some stylized facts regarding debt, private and public investment, and output growth using two bodies of data: the short span since the 2008 global 13 See Lucas and Stokey (1983), Debortoli and Nunes (2010, 2012), and Krusell, Martin, and Rios-Rull (2008). 14 As argued by Chamley (1986), models of optimal taxation generally imply zero taxation of private capital in the long run because private capital becomes a fully elastic source of revenue. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 15 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND financial crisis, and a longer span covering the period 1960–2008. The advantage of the postcrisis data is that, during the crisis, several advanced economies experienced large increases in public debt that were almost entirely unrelated to public investment. The downside, of course, is that much else was happening in these economies, and it may be too early to tell what will be the medium- to long-run impact of the increase in public debt on growth. With this caveat in mind, Figure 4 (top panel) reports the correlation between the change in debt over the period 2009–11 and the change in public gross capital formation in percent of GDP (measured as the average for the period 2009–11 relative to average 2005–07). In general, countries that experienced larger increases in public debt were also those that reduced public investment the most, with the association statistically significant at 5 percent level.15 Of course, sovereigns that experienced the largest increases probably had to do the most belt-tightening as well, so the negative correlation between rising debt and shrinking public investment is not much of a surprise. But it is unlikely to be only the government’s budget constraint at play: public consumption shows no such negative relationship—in fact, the relationship is marginally positive, albeit statistically insignificant (Figure 4, middle panel). This finding likely reflects a pragmatic approach by governments who find it politically easier to cut investment than current expenditure, especially during an economic downturn. But it is noteworthy that the analytical framework developed here would carry the same implication as a normative statement: given the higher inherited debt, and the higher distortionary taxation required to service it, the return to— and therefore the amount of—public investment will be lower. Moreover, again consistent with the analytical framework, the negative relationship between the increase in public debt and the decrease in economywide gross fixed-capital formation holds even more strongly in the data (Figure 4, bottom panel). Turning to more systematic evidence, Table 1 reports regressions of public investment on current or (five-year) lagged public debt using five-year, non-overlapping averages of these variables for a sample of advanced economies over the period 1960–2008. Again, there is a strong negative relationship between public debt and either current or subsequent public investment (Table 1, columns 1–2). But no such negative relationship can be seen between debt and public consumption (Table 1, columns 3–4). Beyond the observation that an economy with higher public debt should—and will—do less public investment, the analytical framework implies that, in general, it is better (for both growth and welfare) to live with high debt than to try to reduce it through distortionary taxation. Table 2 reports standard growth regressions (again using 5-year non-overlapping averages for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] countries). Higher tax rates (measured as revenues in percent of GDP) are indeed associated with lower growth, controlling 15 We are not claiming that the mechanism emphasized by our model is the only factor at play here: political constraints, for example, would likely have played a role in determining the cutbacks in public investment.

WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 18 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND for the other usual growth determinants such as population growth, initial per capita income, terms of trade shocks, inflation, and investment (Table 2, column 1).16 Part of this effect is through lower investment (again, as the framework would suggest); dropping investment, the negative coefficient on taxes becomes larger in absolute value (Table 2, column 2). Nor are these results likely to be driven by reverse causality: if tax revenues are responding to GDP growth, then the estimated coefficient would be positive; the finding of a statistically significant negative coefficient must therefore be in spite of—rather than because of—any possible endogeneity. Moreover, using the Arellano-Bond estimator or instrumenting using value-added tax (VAT) or social security tax rates yields similar results (Table 2, columns 4–6). Finally, it is noteworthy that when current or lagged debt is included in the regression (in addition to taxes), the coefficient is negative but insignificant; inherited public debt may be bad for growth (since taxes will need to be somewhat higher to service the debt even if the government choose to live with the higher debt), but what really kills growth is distortionary taxation to service the debt—and, a fortiori, to pay it down. CONCLUSIONS Advanced economies are facing some of the highest ratios of public debt since World War II. For those countries that are not at imminent risk of losing market access, current policy debates center on the appropriate pace at which to pay down public debt. Those who believe that debt is bad for growth favor a rapid reduction in indebtedness, whereas those who stress Keynesian demand management considerations argue for a measured pace of consolidation, perhaps with a ramping up of public investment while interest rates remain at historic lows. Somewhat lost in this debate is the possibility of simply living with (relatively) high debt, and allowing debt ratios to decline organically through output growth. The purpose of this paper is not to provide direct policy advice, but rather to elicit a debate on whether governments should actively seek to pay down public debt or simply live with high debt. The analytical framework proposed here suggests that this third course, of living with high debt, merits consideration in countries where debt sustainability concerns are not pressing. Indeed, while debt may be bad for growth, it does not follow that it should be paid down as quickly as possible, even abstracting from Keynesian effects on activity and output. At the same time, higher debt may imply lower returns to public capital than prior to the crisis, implying that a scaling-back of investment plans would be appropriate. 16 Our results are very similar when estimating a cross-section regression of growth over the period 1978–2007. In such regressions, contemporaneous tax revenues are significant, whereas lagged tax revenues and lagged debt are not significant variables. However, the literature on the effect of taxes on growth has been less conclusive, as underlined by Easterly and Rebelo (1993). Mendoza, Milesi-Ferretti, and Asea (1997) also found that although taxes affect investment, the effect on growth is not robust. WHEN SHOULD PUBLIC DEBT BE REDUCED? 19 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND The main insights may be summarized in three guiding principles for thinking about public debt and investment dynamics:  Inherited public debt represents a deadweight burden on the economy, reducing both its investment potential and its growth prospects. Although the debt may have been incurred for good reasons, the higher the inherited stock, the poorer the economy (by the present value of the distortionary costs of the taxation need to service the debt). Efficiency dictates that the higher inherited debt and corresponding taxation, the lower should be public and private investment, and the slower will be output growth.  When fiscal space is ample—which can never be established through some mechanical procedure—there is a case for simply living with the debt, paying it down only “opportunistically” when non-distortionary sources of revenue are available and letting the debt ratio decline through growth. The deadweight loss associated with inherited public debt represents a sunk cost—so, abstracting from rollover risk, there is little purpose in paying it down by raising taxes or cutting otherwise-productive government expenditure. Living with the debt in such circumstances represents the best cost-benefit tradeoff.  Debt should be used to smooth the taxes necessary to finance lumpy government expenditures. For public investment, this implies debt-financing of projects whose social marginal product earns at least the market interest rate, but recognizing that the additional debt incurred will need to be serviced with distortionary taxation of factors that may be complementary to public capital, thereby reducing the return to public investment. This cumulative effect on the stock of public capital is likely to be appreciable when public debt is high, implying high level of distortionary taxation. These are just some guiding principles whose application in any particular case will need to take account of country-specific circumstances. Countries facing imminent risk of a curtailment of market access, or that need to re-establish fiscal space against the risk of contingent liabilities or other shocks, naturally do not have the luxury of living with high debt. For others, the appropriate pace depends on the availability of non- (or less) distortionary sources of tax revenue. And for those countries in the fortunate position of enjoying asset price booms, the message must be that they should seize the opportunity to pay down public debt. In sum, the appropriate response to high levels of public debt depends very much on the extent of available fiscal space and other factors. There is no one-size-fits-all message: be it to pay down the debt to reduce the risk of a funding crisis or to live with the debt, letting the debt ratio decline organically through growth. Countries in the yellow and red zones in terms of fiscal space will not be in a position to “live with the debt.” But nor is it the case that countries with ample space— those firmly in the green zone—should rush to pay down their debt.

Condition (2.7) equates the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure to the marginal product of labor, implying from (1.4), that the wage should be the marginal product of labor. Condition (2.8) states that private and public investment should be undertaken to the point that the respective marginal products equal the intertemporal rate of substitution, which, from (1.5), is the market interest rate. When only distortionary taxes are available, however, 0,  and the impact on the government’s ability to raise revenues needs to be taken into account. Therefore, social rather than private marginal products and rates of substitution must be used, as in (2.4)-(2.6). For example, investment may yield a higher social return than the private return because, by raising the marginal product of labor, it makes it easier to raise labor taxes. Nevertheless, a key result is that, even with 0,  the implicit discount rate used by the government in its optimal fiscal program equals the market interest rate.

INTRODUCTION In Alden v. Maine2 the Supreme Court considered whether Congress, pursuant to its Article I powers, can subject a nonconsenting state to a private suit for damages in the state’s own courts. Alternatively viewed, the question was whether a state has sovereign immunity which precludes such suits. The petitioners were employees of the State of Maine who sought monetary damages from the State for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA),3 which specifically authorized such a suit. The Maine courts had dismissed the suit on sovereign immunity grounds. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that Article I of the Constitution does not grant Congress the power to subject a nonconsenting state to a private suit for damages in the state's own courts.4 The Court explained that state immunity to private suits “neither derives from nor is limited by the terms of the Eleventh 1 B.S., University of Florida; J.D., summa cum laude, Michigan State University – Detroit College of Law, 2001.

Florida,9 and is philosophically consistent with other recent “states rights” cases such as New York v. United States,10 and Printz v. United States.11 This note will review the history of state sovereign immunity and congressional power to subject states to lawsuits. Next, this note will examine the holdings and opinions in Alden. Finally, the underlying basis for the Alden decision will be analyzed. II. BACKGROUND Alden v. Maine12 represents the most recent major development in a long-running debate about the nature and extent of state sovereign immunity under the Constitution. Article III of the Constitution provides that “the judicial Power [of the United States] shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . . [and] to Controversies . . . between a State and Citizens of another State.”13 It provides further that “In all Cases . . . in which a State shall be a Party, the Supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.”14 By its text then, Article III taken alone appears to confer both federal question and diversity jurisdiction on the federal courts when a state is a party to a suit. The meaning of this text and its relationship to congressional powers granted elsewhere in the Constitution are at the heart of the sovereign immunity debate. Disagreement about state sovereign immunity dates back to the pre-ratification period. At that time, many states were saddled with Revolutionary War debt and were thus “vitally interested” in whether, under Article III, they would be subject to federal court suits on these debts.15 Consequently, the ratification debates addressed 5 Id. at 713. 6 Id. 7 Id. 8 See id. at 713-14. 9 517 U.S. 44 (1996). 10 505 U.S. 144 (1992). 11 521 U.S. 898 (1997). 12 527 U.S. 706 (1999). 13 U.S. CONST. art.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 505 the state sovereign immunity question primarily within the context of this potential debt enforcement.16 Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist No. 81, considered whether, under Article III, “an assignment of the public securities of one State to the citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute that State in the federal courts.”17 His position was that: [I]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent . . . . Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States and the danger intimated must be merely ideal.18 Although Hamilton was “plainly talking about a suit subject to a federal court’s jurisdiction under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses of Article III,”19 he did not specifically reconcile the apparent conflict between his position and Article III’s diversity jurisdiction language. In supporting and expanding on Hamilton’s theme at the Virginia ratifying convention, however, James Madison suggested that the purpose of the citizen-state diversity jurisdiction clause was to provide for federal jurisdiction only when a state was a plaintiff, not a defendant, or when a state otherwise consented to suit.20 John Marshall, speaking after Madison at the Virginia convention, likewise argued that the clause was only intended to cover suits in which a state was the plaintiff.21 Disputing the views of Madison and Marshall in favor of the plain meaning of the text of Article III, Edmund Randolph argued that “any doubt respecting the construction that a state may be a plaintiff, and not defendant, is taken away by the words where a state shall be a party.”22 Similarly, James Wilson expressed a strong anti-immunity position at the Pennsylvania Convention, arguing that the concept of impartiality inherent in the Constitution requires a federal forum in which individuals and states receive equal treatment.23 Wilson's view was “that the sovereignty resides in the people; they have not parted with it; they have only dispensed such portions of the power as were conceived necessary for the public welfare.”24 16 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 772-73 (Souter, J., dissenting). 17 THE FEDERALIST No. 81, at 125 (Alexander Hamilton) (M.

Georgia33 reached the United States Supreme Court. In Chisholm, the question was presented in the form of a motion to compel an appearance by the State of Georgia, on danger of default, in a common law assumpsit action brought in federal court against the State by Chisholm, a citizen of 25 See id. at 778. 26 See id. at 718, 778-79 (Souter, J., dissenting). 27 Alden, 527 U.S. at 778-79 (Souter, J., dissenting) (citing 1 ELLIOT’S DEBATES 329, 336). 28 Id. at 779-80 (citing 1 ELLIOT’S DEBATES 336). 29 See id. at 724-25, 780 (Souter, J., dissenting). 30 See id. at 778 n.18 (Souter, J., dissenting). 31 Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, 80 (1789). 32 In an earlier case, Van Stophorst v.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 507 South Carolina, to collect on a Revolutionary War debt.34 The Governor and Attorney General of Georgia had been served with notice,35 but the state “refuse[d] to appear and answer. . . [arguing] she [was] a sovereign State and therefore not liable to such actions.”36 The Court rejected this immunity defense and granted the motion in what was effectively a four-to-one majority decision.37 The four concurring Justices, in individual opinions, essentially found that the Constitution meant what it said. They all found a clear authorization for citizen-state diversity jurisdiction in the text of Article III.38 Each rejected a construction of this text which would allow a grant of jurisdiction only when a state was a plaintiff and not a defendant.39 Additionally, at least two of the concurring Justices believed that the concept of state sovereign immunity advanced by Georgia was inconsistent with the principle of popular sovereignty on which the Constitution was based.40 Justice Iredell, the lone dissenter, argued that the Court did not have jurisdiction. However, his argument was not based on a theory of constitutional state sovereign immunity, but rather, on the grounds that Congress had not conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts over unconsenting states. He noted that although the Judiciary Act provided for original jurisdiction in the Supreme Court over all civil controversies “between a State and citizens of another State”41 it went on to provide that any writs issued by the federal courts not specifically provided for by statute must be “agreeable to the principles and usages of law.”42 Justice Iredell interpreted this latter language as directing the Court to issue non-statutory writs only in accordance with the law of a particular state or “[p]rinciples of law common to all the States” 34 See id. at 419-20.

The Eleventh Amendment provides that “[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.”49 By its text, which closely tracks language in Article III, the Amendment appears to be specifically directed toward eliminating federal citizen-state diversity jurisdiction.50 Whether the Eleventh 43 Id. 44 See Chisholm, 2 U.S. at 436-37. 45 Id. at 449.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 509 Amendment had implications for state sovereign immunity beyond this textual construction of its terms was the subject of Hans v. Louisiana.51 Hans, like Chisholm, was a federal court suit brought by an individual in federal court against a state to compel payment on the state’s debt obligations.52 The State of Louisiana had issued coupon bearing bonds in 1874 and concurrently amended its constitution to declare that the bonds created a valid contract by the state.53 In 1879, the state adopted a new constitution which superseded the previous constitution and provided that interest on the 1874 bonds falling due on January 1, 1880 would be defrayed to meet other state expenses.54 Hans, a citizen of Louisiana, held bond coupons affected by this provision and sued the state in federal court for $87,500 plus accrued interest.55 He alleged an impairment of a valid contract by the state in violation of Article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution.56 Louisiana contended it had sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment and the trial court dismissed the suit on that basis.57 Whereas Chisholm involved a state law claim brought against Georgia by a citizen of another state, Hans involved a federal constitutional claim brought against Louisiana by one of its own citizens. Hans thus presented the Court with two distinct questions. Hans first contended that the Eleventh Amendment by its terms barred only diversity jurisdiction in federal courts and had no application when a federal question was being contested.58 He noted that Article III extends federal judicial power to “all cases in law and equity arising under this Constitution” with no qualification as to the character of the parties.59 Consequently, Hans contended that “a state can claim no exemption from suit, if the case is really one arising under the Constitution.”60 The Court rejected this limited reading of the Eleventh Amendment, citing as precedent the cases of Louisiana v. Jumel,61 Hagood v. Southern,62 and In re Ayers.63 Those cases involved similar constitutional claims brought against states by citizens of other states. The Court summarized these precedents by stating “[i]t was not 51 134 U.S. 1 (1890). 52 See Hans, 134 U.S. at 1. 53 See id. at 2. 54 See id. at 2-3. 55 See id. at 3. 56 Id.

On this point, the Court initially noted that because it had extended Eleventh Amendment immunity to federal question suits, if Hans’ argument was upheld, it would produce the “anomalous result” that in such cases, “a state may be sued in the federal courts by its own citizens, though it cannot be sued for a like cause of action by the citizens of other states.”67 However, the Court primarily supported its decision with the broader argument that the states entered the Union with sovereign immunity and that this immunity had not been abrogated by the Constitution.68 To support this broader argument, the Court drew on the positions taken by Hamilton, Madison and Marshall during the ratification debates,69 and Justice Iredell's dissent in Chisholm. The Court characterized the Chisholm decision as an overly textual misconstruction of Article III which was inconsistent with the underlying principle of state sovereign immunity.70 It viewed the Eleventh Amendment as an overruling of the Supreme Court on this point. Thus, in the Court’s view, the Eleventh Amendment did not establish or define the limits of state sovereign immunity; rather, because it specifically reversed the Chisholm decision, the Court understood the Amendment to confirm the existence of a broader immunity.71 The rationale behind Hans, that the principle of state sovereign immunity in federal court was not specifically limited by the precise text of the Eleventh Amendment, was expanded in subsequent cases.72 In Smith v.

The [concurring] justices were more swayed by a close observance of the letter of the constitution, without regard to former experience and usage; and because the letter said that the judicial power shall extend to controversies 'between a state and citizens of another state;' and 'between a state and foreign states, citizens or subjects,' they felt constrained to see in this language a power to enable the individual citizens of one state, of a foreign state, to sue another state of the Union in the federal courts. 71 See id. at 11-12. 72 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 728. 73 178 U.S. 436 (1900). 8https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 511 held that sovereign immunity barred federal court suits against states brought by federal corporations.74 In Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi,75 the Court held that states were similarly immune to suits brought by foreign states.76 In Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak,77 the Court relied on Monaco to further extend the states’ federal court immunity to cover suits brought by Indian Tribes,78 and, in In re New York,79 the Court held that state sovereign immunity extends to suits in admiralty even though “the [Eleventh] Amendment speaks only of suits in law or equity.”80 While the cases in the Hans line espoused the principle of a broad state sovereign immunity, the cases, like Justice Iredell’s Chisholm dissent, still did not squarely address the question of whether Congress has the power to abrogate this immunity.81 In the federal court context, that question was addressed and initially answered in the affirmative in two key cases. The first, Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,82 involved a suit filed in federal district court by employees of the State of Connecticut against various officials of that state.83 The employees alleged sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.84 In 1972, pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment,85 Congress had amended Title VII to specifically authorize private suits of this type.86 The district court granted the plaintiffs a prospective injunction but denied money 74 See Reeves, 178 U.S. at 449. 75 292 U.S. 313 (1934). 76 See Monaco, 292 U.S. at 330-31. 77 501 U.S. 775 (1991). 78 See Blatchford, 501 U.S. at 780-82. 79 256 U.S. 490 (1921). 80 New York, 256 U.S. at 497. Further refinements of the Hans doctrine were provided by the cases of Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410 (1979), and Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89 (1984). In Hall, the State of Nevada was named a defendant in a civil suit brought in a California state court. The California Supreme Court held that the trial court had proper jurisdiction and following a trial, judgment was entered against Nevada. See Hall, 440 U.S. at 411-12. The United States Supreme Court affirmed, holding that a state’s sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment does not extend to suits brought in the courts of another state. See id. at 426-27. More recently, in Pennhurst, the Court held that a state’s Eleventh Amendment immunity bars a federal court, in an exercise of pendent jurisdiction, from enforcing a state’s own laws against officials of that state when the state itself is the real party in interest.

[an award of money damages to a private individual] against [a] state as a means of enforcing the substantive guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment"" or whether such power was precluded by the “shield of sovereign immunity afforded the State by the Eleventh Amendment.”89 The Bitzer majority, in an opinion by Justice Rehnquist, acknowledged the principle of state sovereign immunity set forth in Hans, but held that this otherwise effective immunity was specifically limited by the authority granted to Congress by the Fourteenth Amendment.90 As explained by the Court, the Civil War Amendments represented a “shift in the federal-state balance” and granted Congress the power to intrude into the states’ spheres of autonomy with respect to matters embraced by those Amendments.91 Applying this view to the facts at hand, Justice Rehnquist wrote “[w]e think that Congress may, in determining what is ‘appropriate legislation’ for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against States or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.”92 Justice Brennan concurred in the judgment but rejected the notion of a broad constitutionally based state sovereign immunity. In Justice Brennan's view, the states, by ratifying the Constitution, had surrendered their immunity with respect to all of the enumerated powers granted to Congress.93 Justice Brennan believed Congress could have validly enacted the legislation under either its Commerce Clause or Fourteenth Amendment powers.94 In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Stevens agreed with Justice Brennan on this point, writing, “the commerce power is broad enough to . . . provide[] the necessary support for the 1972 Amendments to Title VII.”95 This commerce power question was put squarely before the Court in the second key case, Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.96 Union Gas was an appeal by the State of Pennsylvania of a federal court of appeals decision finding the state subject to a private suit97 brought pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 87 See id. at 450. 88 See id. 89 Id. at 448. 90 See id. at 456. 91 Fitzpatrick, 427 U.S. at 455. 92 Id. at 456. 93 See id. at 457-58 (Brennan, J. concurring). 94 See id.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 513 (CERCLA).98 Congress enacted CERCLA and the subsequent Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA)99 pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers to provide a mechanism to clean up hazardous waste sites.100 In the district court, Pennsylvania argued that the private claim against it was barred by its Eleventh Amendment immunity.101 The Court of Appeals ultimately rejected this argument, holding that CERCLA, as amended by SARA, clearly expressed congressional intent to subject states to private suits for monetary damages and that Congress had the power to do so under the Commerce Clause.102 The Supreme Court granted certiorari and affirmed in a plurality decision which again revealed the two opposing views in the Court on the sovereign immunity debate. Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens, in an opinion announcing the judgment of the Court set forth the “pro-congressional power” view. He began by noting that, although the Court had never “squarely resolved” the question of Congress’s Commerce Clause authority vis-a-vis state immunity, the relevant precedent, including Fitzpatrick, supported a decision in favor of congressional power.103 The fundamental underpinning of Justice Brennan's argument was that, “in approving the commerce power, the States consented to suits against them based on congressionally created causes of action.”104 Justice Brennan stated: Because the Commerce Clause withholds power from the States at the same time as it confers it on Congress, and because the congressional power thus conferred would be incomplete without the authority to render States liable in damages, it must be that, to the extent that the States gave Congress the authority to regulate commerce, they also relinquished their immunity where Congress found it necessary, in exercising this authority, to render them liable.105 Justice Brennan rejected the idea that Hans conflicted with or precluded this conclusion. He noted that while Hans had indeed upheld a principle of sovereign immunity, it had not tested the question of whether that immunity was constitutional 98 42 U.S.C. §§ 9601-75 (1994). CERCLA provided for the hazardous waste “Superfund” program. 99 Pub. L. No. 99-499, 100 Stat. 1613 (1986) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 9613 (1994). 100 See Union Gas, 491 U.S. at 7. The United States sued Union Gas Company under CERCLA to recover costs of an environmental cleanup (the country’s first “Superfund” site) and Union Gas filed a third party complaint against Pennsylvania, alleging that the State was at least partially liable for the costs.

Justice Scalia rejected a straight textual interpretation of Article III and the Eleventh Amendment in favor of a recognition of certain background postulates which must be taken into account when interpreting the meaning of the Constitution.110 He argued that one such postulate was the principle of sovereign immunity and that, while the states had surrendered some aspects of this immunity in ratifying the Constitution, they had not surrendered immunity to suits by private individuals.111 Because, in Justice Scalia’s view, this retained immunity was a background assumption under which the Constitution was adopted, such immunity possessed a constitutional dimension and thus could not be abrogated by statute.112 Justice Scalia argued that Hans served to validate his argument, stating: What we said in Hans was, essentially, that the Eleventh Amendment was important not merely for what it said but for what it reflected: a consensus that the doctrine of sovereign immunity . . . was part of the understood background against which the Constitution was adopted, and which its jurisdictional provisions did not mean to sweep away.113 106 See id. at 18-19. 107 Id. at 23-24 (Stevens, J. concurring). It is important to emphasize the distinction between our two Eleventh Amendments. There is first the correct and literal interpretation of the plain language of the Eleventh Amendment . . .

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 515 Thus, in Justice Scalia’s view, “state immunity from suit in federal courts is a structural component of federalism” which cannot be abridged by Congress pursuant to its Article I powers.114 Justice Scalia distinguished Fitzpatrick on the grounds that the law in question in that case had been enacted pursuant to Congress's Fourteenth Amendment authority rather than its Article I powers. Because the Fourteenth Amendment, unlike Article I, had been adopted subsequent to the Eleventh Amendment, Justice Scalia contended that, with respect to its provisions, it represented a surrender by the states of the background principle of sovereign immunity embodied by the Eleventh Amendment.115 Seven years later, the Court reconsidered the Article I/Commerce Clause question in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida.116 The two opposing views remained the same but the makeup of the Court had shifted in favor of the federalism position.117 Consequently, the Court overturned Union Gas118 and set out the rule that Congress, pursuant to its Article I powers, may not authorize private suits for money damages against unconsenting states in federal courts.119 The decision led one lower federal court to complain: “It is unfortunately a tragic consequence of the Supreme Court's inability to maintain the status of its own precedents that all this time and effort has been wasted. Compare Seminole Tribe (holding that Congress lacks power) with Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. . . . (upholding Congress's power).”120 Writing for a majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by the other Union Gas dissenters Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy as well as Justice Thomas, defended this deviation from the general principle of stare decisis. Initially, the majority characterized Union Gas as a “deeply fractured” plurality decision, noting that Justice Brennan’s Union Gas opinion had been joined by only three other justices and that Justice White, who had provided the decisive vote, had written a separate opinion “in order to indicate his disagreement with the plurality’s rationale.”121 Additionally, citing the lower court decision in Seminole Tribe itself 114 Id. at 38. 115 Id. at 41-42. 116 517 U.S. 44 (1996).

It may not be accurate though, to imply that Justice White’s purpose in writing separately was to express his disagreement with Justice Brennan’s views on the Commerce Clause question. While it is true that Justice White wrote separately in Union Gas, his opinion was devoted almost entirely to his argument that CERCLA as amended by SARA did not contain an unmistakable statement of congressional intent to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the states. Justice White devoted just two 13Published by EngagedScholarship@CSU, 2000 516 CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 48:503 along with one other case, the majority stated that Union Gas had “created confusion among the lower courts.”122 Finally, Justice Rehnquist complained that Union Gas had “deviated sharply from our established federalism jurisprudence and essentially eviscerated our decision in Hans.”123 This last point may be the most telling in that it highlights the incompatibility of Union Gas with the majority’s view of the Hans line of cases. While Seminole Tribe effectively cut off the federal courts as a forum for suits against unconsenting states by private individuals under Commerce Clause legislation, the case did not directly address the related question of Congress's power to authorize such suits in state courts. This state court question had, however, been previously considered in Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Commission.124 Hilton was a private suit against an arm of the State of South Carolina which operated a railroad engaged in interstate commerce as a common carrier.125 The petitioner, Kenneth Hilton, was an employee of the railroad who sought to recover, pursuant to the terms of the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA),126 for alleged job related injuries.127 FELA provided that “[e]very common carrier while engaging in commerce . . . shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce.”128 A similar FELA claim brought in federal court had been upheld against a state sovereign immunity defense in the 1964 case of Parden v. Terminal Railway of the Alabama State Docks Department.129 The Parden Court had held that, by referring to “every common carrier” in FELA, Congress had intended to create a cause of action against even state-owned railroads130 and further, that by operating a railroad in interstate commerce a state sentences to the question of whether the Commerce Clause grants Congress this abrogation authority, stating: This brings me to the question whether Congress has the constitutional power to abrogate the States’ immunity. In that respect, I agree with the conclusion reached by Justice Brennan . . . that Congress has the authority under Article I to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States, although I do not agree with much of his reasoning. Union Gas, 491 U.S. at 57 (White, J. concurring). By the same token, Justice White’s statement does not necessarily support the conclusion that the Union Gas plurality opinion was “deeply fractured” because Justice White did not elaborate on the nature of his disagreement with Justice Brennan’s reasoning. 122 Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 64. 123 Id. 124 502 U.S. 197 (1991). 125 Id. at 199. 126 45 U.S.C. § 51 (1994). 127 Hilton, 502 U.S. at 199. 128 Id. at 201 n.1. 129 377 U.S. 184 (1964). 130 Id. at 190. 14https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 517 implicitly consented to FELA suits and waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity defense.131 Against the background of Parden, Hilton initially filed his suit in federal district court. However, while Hilton’s suit was pending, the U.S. Supreme Court in Welch v. Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation,132 effectively held that FELA did not contain a statement of congressional intent to abrogate a state's Eleventh Amendment immunity which was sufficient to support the constructive waiver theory of Parden,133 and Parden was consequently overruled to the extent it was inconsistent with Welch.134 In light of Welch, Hilton refiled his suit in South Carolina state court. The state trial court dismissed the suit and the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed.135 The basis for the dismissal was not that the state had immunity, but that FELA did not create a cause of action against the state in state court.136 The South Carolina Supreme Court, relying on Welch’s holding that FELA did not contain language sufficiently clear to create a cause of action in federal courts, concluded that the statute likewise did not sufficiently evidence congressional intent to create a cause of action against the states in state court.137 The issue before the United States Supreme Court in Hilton, then, was whether FELA “create[d] a cause of action against a state-owned railroad, enforceable in state court.”138 The Court reversed the South Carolina Supreme Court and held that the statute did create such a cause of action and ordered that Hilton's suit be allowed to proceed.139 The Court acknowledged the decision in Welch but stated that the “unmistakably clear language” test for determining whether Congress intended to abrogate state immunity in federal courts was not necessarily dispositive in 131 See id. at 192. 132 483 U.S. 468 (1987) 133 See Welch, 483 U.S. at 472. In Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985), the Court held that, when acting pursuant to its authority under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress could only abrogate state immunity in federal court “by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” Id. at 242. In applying this test to Welch, the Court assumed arguendo that Congress’s power to abrogate state immunity was not limited to the Fourteenth Amendment. See Welch, 483 U.S. at 475. Because FELA did not pass the “unmistakably clear language” test, it was not necessary to resolve any additional constitutional question and the Court expressly refrained from deciding whether Congress had abrogation power pursuant to the Commerce Clause.

If this had not been the case, the discussion of congressional intent would have been superfluous. The decision itself makes clear this underlying assumption. After explaining that a “clear statement inquiry” was not required because Parden had already established that Congress, in enacting FELA, “intended to create a cause of action against the states,”143 the Court stated “when the rule [of a clear statement of congressional intent] is either overcome or inapplicable so that a federal statute does impose liability upon the States, the Supremacy Clause makes that statute the law in every State, fully enforceable in state court.”144 Justice O'Connor, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Scalia, did not contend that states have immunity from federal question suits in their own courts. Rather, she argued that the “clear statement” test was applicable and had not been met. Justice O’Connor wrote, “a federal statute requiring the States to entertain damages suits against themselves in state courts is precisely the kind of legislation that requires a clear statement, because of the long-established principle that a State cannot normally be sued in its own courts without its consent.”145 Justice O’Connor’s primary argument was that the decision in Welch, finding no “unmistakably clear” statement of congressional intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity, mandated a similar finding with respect to whether FELA created a valid private cause of action against a state in the state’s own courts.146 She rejected the idea that the two inquiries were not the same.147 Thus, the dissenting opinion also rested on the assumption that Congress does have the power to abrogate a state’s immunity in state courts if the “clear statement” standard is met. The meaning of Hilton with respect to other assertions of state immunity in state courts was evaluated differently by lower courts in subsequent cases. In the 1998 case of Jacoby v. Arkansas Department of Education, Vocational and Technical Education Division,148 the Arkansas Supreme Court upheld a private federal question 140 Id. at 205-06 (differentiating between “application of a rule of constitutional law” and “an ordinary rule of statutory construction”). 141 Id. at 204-05. 142 Id. at 202. 143 Hilton, 502 U.S. at 200. 144 Id. at 207. 145 Id. at 208 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). 146 Id. 147 Id. at 208-09. 148 962 S.W.2d 773 (Ark. 1998). 16https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 519 suit against the State of Arkansas, holding that Hilton had established that states have no constitutional sovereign immunity superior to the Supremacy Clause.149 That same year, in an essentially identical case, Alden v. State,150 the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine reached a conflicting conclusion, ruling that state sovereign immunity did prevail in the state's own courts when the state is sued for violating a federal statute.151 The Maine court acknowledged Hilton, but held that, in the light of Seminole Tribe, Hilton was no longer dispositive of the question.152 III. THE DECISION A. Facts and Procedural History Alden v. Maine,153 like Jacoby, its Arkansas counterpart, involved a claim against a state pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA).154 The FLSA was enacted by Congress pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers and imposes standards such as minimum wages and maximum hours on all covered employers.155 Prior to Alden and Seminole Tribe,156 the FLSA had been the subject of a series of Supreme Court cases testing the threshold question of whether application of the FLSA to the states was a valid exercise of the commerce power or whether implicit constitutional principles of state sovereignty served to make the states immune to federal Commerce Clause regulation when the states acted in performance of their governmental functions. This question was broader than the question subsequently raised in Alden, of whether state sovereign immunity precludes congressional authorization of private suits for damages against the states as a means to enforce the FLSA. As originally enacted, the FLSA excluded the states from its requirements. In 1966 Congress amended the law to cover employees of hospitals, institutions and schools, including those operated by the states or their political subdivisions.157 In Maryland v. Wirtz, Maryland and twenty-seven other states challenged this expansion of the Act on grounds of state sovereignty.158 Specifically, the states argued that an otherwise valid exercise of Congress’s commerce power is unconstitutional when it interferes with the states in “the performance of governmental functions.”159 The Court specifically rejected the idea that the 149 Id. at 775-76. 150 715 A.2d 172 (Me. 1998). 151 Id. at 175 (“[W]e conclude that sovereign immunity protects the State from defending this federal cause of action in its own courts.”). 152 Id. 153 527 U.S. 706 (1999). 154 29 U.S.C. § 201-19 (1994). 155 See, e.g., Maryland v.

Usery.162 National League of Cities was a challenge to 1974 amendments to the FLSA which had the effect of expanding the law to cover almost all state employees.163 As in Wirtz, the appellant States argued that the law transgressed recognized constitutional principles of state sovereignty.164 This time the Court sided with the states. In an opinion written by Justice Rehnquist, the Court overruled Wirtz165 and held that Congress may not, pursuant to its commerce power, directly regulate the states in areas involving traditional government functions.166 Contrary to Wirtz, the Court in National League of Cities concluded that the federal system of government set forth in the Constitution implicitly precluded such regulation.167 Rather than settling the matter, the decision in National League of Cities led to a dispute between the federal government and the states, and disagreement in the lower courts, as to which state activities constituted traditional government functions and were thus immune from regulation under the Commerce Clause. This question reached the Supreme Court in the 1985 case of Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority.168 In Garcia, the Court overruled National League of Cities and rejected the “traditional government function” test as unworkable.169 The Court stated that any scheme which required characterization of state governmental functions as “traditional”, “integral” or “necessary” as a prerequisite for immunity from federal regulation would be incompatible with constitutional principles of federalism in that the ultimate immunity decision would inevitably be made by an unelected federal judge.170 In effect, the federal judiciary would be passing judgment on whether or not it favored a particular state policy. The Court stated that a judicial role of this type “disserves principles of democratic self-governance”171 and explained further that the Constitution protected state sovereign interests by giving the states a role in the selection of the national government, not through “judicially created limitations on federal power.”172 Garcia then, by removing the commerce 160 Id. 161 Id. at 188. 162 426 U.S. 833 (1976). 163 Id. at 836-37. 164 Id. at 841. 165 Id. at 855. 166 Id. at 852. 167 National League of Cities, 426 U.S. at 851. 168 469 U.S. 528, 530-31 (1985). 169 Id. at 531. 170 Id. at 546. 171 Id. at 547. 172 Id. at 552. 18https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 521 power limitations established in National League of Cities, appeared to have cleared the way for private FLSA suits against the states.173 Little did the Garcia majority know that in doing so, the Court had helped to set the stage for Alden. The Alden litigation originated in federal district court as Mills v. Maine.174 That suit was filed in 1992 by probation officers employed by the State of Maine seeking overtime pay pursuant to the FLSA.175 In 1996, in the wake of Seminole Tribe, the district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, leading to that court's bitter complaint about the failure of the Supreme Court to follow its own precedent.176 The dismissal was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.177 Subsequently, John Alden and other probation officers filed the Mills complaint in Maine Superior Court in 1996.178 The Superior Court dismissed the suit on the basis of state sovereign immunity and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court affirmed.179 Because this decision conflicted with that of the Arkansas court in Jacoby, the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to squarely address whether the states have an immunity to private suits in their own courts comparable to the federal court immunity set out in Seminole Tribe.180 B. The Decision Alden was argued before the Supreme Court in March of 1999, three years after Seminole Tribe was decided, and in many ways Alden parallels that earlier decision. As in Seminole Tribe, the Court favored the “federalism” position, and affirmed the decision of the Maine court to dismiss Alden's suit. The Alden decision was carried by the same five to four majority which prevailed in Seminole Tribe181 and many of the arguments on both sides of the case had been employed or foreshadowed in Seminole Tribe, or earlier, in Union Gas.182 1. The Majority Opinion In an opinion delivered by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that Congress does not have the power under Article I of the Constitution to “subject nonconsenting 173 The Garcia plaintiffs never prevailed on their claim though. On remand the district court refused to apply the Supreme Court decision retroactively and the appellate court affirmed. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metro.

The decision expands the concept of the “underlying postulate” of state sovereign immunity from that of a federal court immunity anchored in the Eleventh Amendment as per Seminole Tribe, to a broader federal and state court immunity which is “confirmed” by the language of the Tenth Amendment and independent of the Eleventh Amendment.185 The Court summarized its position and rationale for the decision by stating that immunity from private suit was a “fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the states enjoyed” prior to ratifying the Constitution and that this immunity continues “except as altered by the plan of the Convention or certain constitutional amendments.”186 In the Court’s view, neither the powers granted to Congress by Article I, nor the Supremacy Clause, nor the jurisdictional grants of Article III constituted an effective alteration of this “fundamental aspect” of state sovereignty. The Court supported its position with two primary arguments.187 Initially, and most fundamentally, the Court contended that state sovereign immunity having the parameters established in Alden, was an “original understanding” upon which the Constitution was ratified. To buttress this original intent argument, the Court advanced the structural argument that a Congressional power to abrogate this state immunity would be inconsistent with the system of divided state and federal authority set out by the Constitution. Throughout its opinion, the Court also drew support from history and precedent, canvassing its prior immunity decisions beginning with Hans188 to find both a “settled doctrinal understanding” that state sovereign immunity is implicit in the Constitution189 as well as “theory and reasoning . . . suggest[ing]” that this immunity extends to state courts.190 These arguments are summarized in more detail in the following sections. a. Original Intent According to the Court's historical analysis, at the time of ratification, the English Crown had enjoyed an unqualified immunity from suit,191 and, although Americans 183 Alden, 527 U.S. at 712. 184 See, e.g., id. at 739-40 (“[T]he Constitution reserves to the States a constitutional immunity from private suits in their own courts which cannot be abrogated by Congress.”). 185 See id. at 712-14. 186 Id. at 713. 187 See, e.g., Alden, 527 U.S. at 713 (referring to the Constitution’s history and structure). 188 Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890). 189 Alden, 527 U.S. at 728. 190 Id. at 745. 191 See id. at 715 (Quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 234- 35, (1765). 20https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 523 “had rejected other aspects of English political theory,” this English concept of sovereignty had been universally adopted by the states.192 Reflecting this underlying assumption, the Court began its discussion of original intent by stating “[t]he generation that designed and adopted our federal system considered immunity from private suit central to sovereign dignity.”193 As evidence of this, the Court cited Alexander Hamilton’s statement in The Federalist No. 81 that the states would retain their sovereign immunity unless it was surrendered pursuant to plan of the convention, as well as the supporting statements of James Madison and John Marshall made at the Virginia ratifying convention.194 The Court drew further support from the fact that several states, prior to ratification, had proposed amendments or issued declarations designed to limit or eliminate any language in Article III which appeared to impinge on state immunity.195 Of course, one significant event in the historical record which might directly contradict the idea that an unconditional state immunity was a fundamental view of the founding generation is the Chisholm196 decision. Just five years after ratification, when directly presented with the question, four of the five Supreme Court justices concluded that the provisions of Article III describing federal court jurisdiction over the states, precluded any conflicting state immunity.197 Consequently, an essential component of the Court's rationale, both in Seminole Tribe and Alden, was that Chisholm was an incorrect decision and contrary to a true fundamental understanding of the founders. As in Hans a century earlier, the majority described the Chisolm decision as resulting from an overemphasis on the text of Article III, with insufficient weight given to “either the practice or the understanding that prevailed in the States at the time the Constitution was adopted.”198 In contrast, Justice Iredell’s Chisholm dissent, with its focus on then existing state practice, is cited throughout Alden as reflecting the true implicit constitutional design.199 Consistent with this idea, the Court stated that the Chisholm decision created “profound shock” in the nation and cited statements to this effect from both the Massachusetts and Georgia legislatures.200 As primary proof of its position, though, the Court pointed to the subsequent enactment of the Eleventh Amendment, noting the “swiftness and near unanimity with which . . . [it] was adopted.”201 192 Id. 193 Id. 194 See id. at 716-18; see also, supra text accompanying notes 17-21. 195 See supra notes 26-29 and accompanying text; Alden, 527 U.S. at 719 (referring to “the expressed understanding of the only state conventions to address the issue in explicit terms.”). 196 Chisholm v.

The Court specifically rejected as unsupportable the idea that Chisholm was a correct interpretation of the Constitution and that the Eleventh Amendment therefore, constituted a change to the constitutional design.202 Finally, as circumstantial support for its original intent argument, the Court looked at early congressional practice to provide contemporaneous evidence of the Constitution's meaning. In this inquiry, the Court uncovered no instance in which an early Congress enacted a statute which would have subjected nonconsenting states to private actions in state courts. From this fact, the Court inferred that early Congresses had assumed they did not have the power to authorize such suits.203 b. Structuralism Consistent with its original intent position, the Court argued that the constitutional system of divided state and federal authority is incompatible with a congressional power to subject states to private suits in their own courts. In the Court’s view, congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity in this way would jeopardize the federal structure by tipping the balance of power too strongly in favor of the federal government. The Court noted that the Constitution reserves a “vital role” for the states in the “fundamental processes of governance.”204 This can be seen both in those textual provisions of the Constitution which expressly mention the states and assume their continued existence, and in the fact that the Constitution grants only limited powers to the federal government.205 Further, the Tenth Amendment confirms “the constitutional role of the states as sovereign entities.”206 These aspects of the constitutional design “reserve[] to . . . [the states] a substantial portion of the Nation’s primary sovereignty” and entitle[] them to “the dignity and essential attributes” of sovereignty.207 The states, therefore, exist as sovereign bodies, not “mere provinces or political corporations,” and when operating within their sphere of sovereignty, the states are supreme and independent of the federal government.208 On this foundation, the Court argued that granting Congress the power to subject the states to private suits in their own courts would create an unacceptable compromise of constitutional federalism. 202 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 721-22. 203 See id. at 744. 204 Id. at 713. 205 See id. 206 Id.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 525 Initially, the Court described a direct threat to state sovereignty, noting that private suits could create unacceptable financial burdens on the states, thereby giving Congress a leverage over state governments which would not be consistent with the constitutional design.209 Ultimately, in the Court's view, such suits could effectively constitute a federal power to “comandeer the entire political machinery of the State against its will and at the behest of individuals.”210 Additionally, by blurring the line between federal and state authority, and by pitting state judiciaries against the states' political branches, a congressional power to subject states to private suits in their own courts would directly affect the political accountability of state governments which is central to our system of representative democracy. On this point, the Court stated that private suits would place an “unwarranted strain on the States' ability to govern in accordance with the will of their citizens.”211 As a second structural point, the Court noted that whereas the Articles of Confederation had provided for regulation of the states as political entities, the founders had deliberately rejected that system in favor of one in which the Congress, concurrently with the states, regulates the citizenry directly.212 Consequently, in the Court's view, even when the federal government is operating within its own sphere (i.e., within its constitutional powers), Congress may be precluded from acting directly upon or through the states.213 This position served as the basis for the Court's rejection of the petitioners’ argument that the powers of Congress enumerated in Article I, together with the Supremacy Clause, evidenced a relinquishment by the states of any sovereign immunity they might have had with respect to suits brought under federal law. The Court pointed out that while the Supremacy Clause makes federal acts the supreme law of the land, binding on judges in every state, the Clause only applies to laws made pursuant to the Constitution.214 Because the FLSA215 and similar laws would violate the implicit constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity, they can not be said to have been enacted pursuant to the Constitution and, so, are outside the aegis of the Supremacy Clause.216 The Court applied this same reasoning with 209 See id. at 750. 210 Id. at 749. 211 Id. at 750-51. 212 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 714 (quoting J.

Precedent Throughout its opinion, the Court drew on prior decisions in the Hans line of cases (“authoritative interpretations by this Court”218) to support its positions.219 Although conceding that these earlier cases dealt directly only with immunity in federal courts, the majority argued that the logic of the decisions is equally applicable to litigation in state courts.220 Accordingly, the majority cited extensively to prior cases to establish that “[t]he theory and reasoning of our earlier cases suggest the states do retain a constitutional immunity in their own courts.”221 Despite its reliance on these precedents, the Court acknowledged that the rationales underlying prior immunity cases were not always consistent with respect to the state court question,222 and attempted to reconcile, dismiss or distinguish the various cases which appear to conflict with Alden. Of these, the Court singled out Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Commission223 and Nevada v. Hall224 as meriting more than just a brief comment.225 Nevada v. Hall dealt with the issue of whether one state can be sued in the courts of another state (rather than in its own courts) and, on the basis of that factual difference, the Court argued that language from the case was not relevant to the question presented in Alden.226 Hilton, on the other hand, did deal directly with the state court question presented in Alden and the Court acknowledged that the case 216 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 732 (“The Constitution, by delegating to Congress the power to establish the supreme law of the land when acting within its enumerated powers, does not foreclose a State from asserting immunity to claims arising under federal law merely because that law derives . . . from the national power.”). 217 See id. at 732-33 (quoting Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 923-24 (1997)).

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 527 could be read to support the petitioners' position.227 However, the Court found several ways to distinguish Hilton, first noting that because the respondent in Hilton had not advanced sovereign immunity as a defense, that issue had not been squarely presented.228 The Court also seemed to imply that the concept of waiver of immunity or consent to suit which had supported the Parden decision in the federal court context (prior to Welch), had in some way been a factor in the Hilton decision.229 Finally, the Court characterized Hilton as having been simply a pragmatic decision to uphold stare decisis in light of the substantial reliance by states and workers on FELA.230 The Court effectively tied together its “prior decisions” arguments by stating that it is “settled doctrine” (i.e., “settled” by Seminole Tribe) that the states possess a sovereign immunity in federal court which Congress can not abrogate under its Article I powers and, that its prior decisions imply that the states retain an equivalent immunity in their own courts. Thus when considered together, these two ideas lead to the conclusion that states possess an immunity in their own courts which is superior to Congress’s Article I power.231 d. Conclusion In concluding its opinion the Court stressed the fact that state sovereign immunity to private suits would not render the states completely immune to federal regulation and noted several ways in which states could still be subject to judicial review of their compliance with federal law.232 States might, for example, voluntarily consent to private suits and their consent to suits brought by the federal government is implicit in the Constitution.233 Additionally, as per Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,234 the states’ sovereign immunity does not extend to private causes of action created by Congress under the enforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.235 Finally, the Court pointed out that sovereign immunity applies only to states and not to lesser entities such as municipal corporations, and that state officers, under the doctrine of Ex parte Young,236 could be subject to private suit as individuals.237 227 See id. at 737.

The Dissenting Opinion In a dissenting opinion which was joined in by the other Seminole Tribe dissenters,238 Justice Souter rejected the Alden decision in its entirety. The dissent contested each element of the Alden majority's position and concluded that the decision was indefensible and unrealistic.239 a. Original Intent Justice Souter devoted the bulk of his dissent to contesting the Court's original intent argument. In this regard, he first considered the nature of the state sovereign immunity which was set forth in the majority’s opinion and then he examined whether there is any evidence that such a concept of immunity was so fundamental to the founding generation that it should be held to be implicit in the constitutional design. In relation to the first point, Justice Souter argued that despite the majority’s references to an English origin for the American concept of sovereign immunity of the states, the immunity established in Alden is not actually consistent with the principles on which the sovereignty of the English Crown was based.240 Specifically, drawing from Blackstone, Brackton and other authorities, he contended that English immunity was a common law concept under which “no feudal lord could be sued in his own court.”241 In England, Acts of Parliament declared the Crown imperial and there was no court above the King’s, thus no writ could run against him.242 This was the common law basis for the King's immunity. On the other hand, the sovereign immunity of the states established in Alden, exists even beyond their own courts and is indefeasible by statute. Thus, this type of sovereign immunity could not historically have been an incorporation or continuation of the traditional understanding in England. In light of this inconsistency with the English common law concept of sovereign immunity, Justice Souter examined the contours of the immunity established by the majority and concluded that what the Court had found to be implicit in the constitutional design was the “natural law” concept of sovereign immunity, under which immunity from private suits is seen as an inherent and absolute element of the sovereignty of the states.243 237 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 756-57. The Court’s final concluding point was a finding that the State of Maine had not waived its immunity or consented to Alden’s suit. See id. 238 See id. at 760.

In his Seminole Tribe dissent, Justice Souter elaborated on the two sovereign immunity doctrines: 26https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 529 Having defined the immunity in question, Justice Souter then posed what he saw as the fundamental question: whether it could be said that this natural law view of sovereign immunity was widely held in the pre-ratification era.244 He concluded that, rather than showing a prevailing acceptance of a well-defined immunity, the available evidence brought to light disagreement, uncertainty and ambiguity as to whether state sovereign immunity existed and if it did exist, what its contours were.245 In arriving at that conclusion, Justice Souter first looked at early American history, noting that prior to independence, the American Colonies were not sovereign entities and that some colonial charters were held by corporations or entities which were subject to suit.246 Following independence, two states adopted as constitutions existing charters which provided for suit against the state,247 while other states appeared to have incorporated the common law immunity of England.248 Justice Souter summarized this historical information as indicating that “[a]round the time of the Constitutional Convention . . . there existed among the states some diversity of practice with respect to sovereign immunity,” but he found no evidence that any state had adopted the natural law type of immunity.249 With respect to the Constitutional Convention itself and the ratification debates, Justice Souter agreed with the majority that the subject of the immunity of a state in its own courts was not specifically addressed.250 However, while the majority took this as evidence that such immunity was so well settled as to be beyond discussion,251 Justice Souter’s view was that the silence on the issue simply indicated that the founders never specifically considered whether state courts might be forums for federal question suits against the states.252 The issue of state sovereign immunity in the federal courts was discussed at the ratification debates though, and Justice Souter acknowledged the statements by Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall which indicate that state immunity in federal fora would be maintained under the Constitution. However, he pointed out that other The one rule [natural law] holds that the King or the Crown, as the font of law, is not bound by the law’s provisions; the other [common law] provides that the King or Crown, as the font of justice, is not subject to suit in its own courts . . . . The one rule limits the reach of substantive law; the other, the jurisdiction of the courts.

While the majority interpreted this as evidencing a fundamental understanding of a sovereign immunity that Article III did not abrogate,257 Justice Souter viewed it as evidence that those states either believed that Article III as written did subject them to private suits, or at least considered the meaning of Article III to be uncertain.258 Turning next to the Chisholm decision, Justice Souter argued that regardless of the subsequent adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, the significance of the Chisholm decision to Alden is that it demonstrates that at the time of ratification there was no general understanding “that a state’s sovereign immunity from suit in its own courts was an inherent [natural law], and not merely a common-law [defeasible by statute], advantage.”259 Justice Souter argued that while the five Chisholm opinions displayed a divergence of view on the question, none of them, not even that of Justice Iredell, espoused the “Hamiltonian” concept of an immutable, constitutional state sovereign immunity.260 “This dearth of support,” Justice Souter contended, seriously undercut the majority’s original understanding rationale.261 Consistent with his interpretation of the Chisholm decision, Justice Souter rejected the majority’s position that the Eleventh Amendment serves to restore an original understanding of the Constitution which includes Alden-type state sovereign immunity. Justice Souter contended that because there was no such prevailing 253 See id. at 772-78.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 531 understanding at the time of ratification, that understanding could not have been re- established by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment.262 He viewed the Eleventh Amendment as a fact-driven development in an evolving area of constitutional law which served only to settle the limited question of citizen-state diversity jurisdiction in federal court.263 To leave no stone unturned, Justice Souter also assumed arguendo that the natural law theory of state sovereign immunity in state courts had in fact been the original understanding of the founders, and asked whether that would justify the majority's decision.264 He concluded that, even under that assumption, the decision would be unsupportable because the natural law theory of sovereign immunity, as it was known to the founders, was based on the proposition that a law can not be held against the authority that made it.265 In England, where the Crown was then considered the font of all law, the practical effect of the natural law theory would have been no different from that of England’s common law based immunity.266 However, in the United States, the states were not the font of federal legislation. Consequently, if the founders had intended to adopt the natural law theory of sovereign immunity, it would not have implied an immunity from suits arising under federal law, even if the suits were brought in the states’ own courts.267 Finally, addressing the Court's historical argument that early congresses had never enacted legislation which would have authorized private suits against states in state courts, Justice Souter was apparently willing to acknowledge the majority’s claim that there may have been no such federal statutes to prior to FELA.268 Rather than taking this as evidence that Congress lacks such power, Justice Souter explained the absence of such statutes as the necessary consequence of an earlier belief that Congress did not have the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the states on certain subjects. Because Garcia had established that the States are subject to federal law, even when acting in pursuance of traditional government functions, the earlier record was not directly relevant in Justice Souter's view.269 b. Structuralism Justice Souter disputed both of the majority's principal structural arguments. First, he argued that while the system of federalism inherent in the Constitution makes the States sovereign within their own spheres, it does not make them 262 See id. at 792-94 (Souter, J. dissenting). 263 See id. at 793-94. 264 Id. at 795-96. 265 See id. at 796. 266 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 765 n.4. 267 See id. at 798. 268 See id. at 804 (Souter, J., dissenting). 269 See id. at 804-07. “[T]he dearth of prior private federal claims entertained against the states in state courts does not tell us anything, and reflects nothing but an earlier and less expansive application of the commerce power.” Id. at 806. 29Published by EngagedScholarship@CSU, 2000 532 CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 48:503 sovereign with respect to the powers delegated to the federal government.270 Consequently, he rejected the Court’s position that private suits are inconsistent with constitutional federalism because they might threaten political accountability or fiscal health within the states. In Justice Souter’s view, if such a threat to a state were to arise, it would only be due to a state's contravention of the will of the entire nation in an area within the federal power. In such a situation, any resulting strain on the state should be seen as the intended effect of the federal system.271 Similarly, Justice Souter dismissed the majority's contention that the states’ sovereign dignity must be protected, arguing that sovereign dignity was a concept which developed in the context of monarchies and, hence, is completely out of place with a republican state.272 The dissent also contested the majority’s second structural point that because the Constitution grants power to the federal government to directly regulate the citizenry, it precludes federal regulation of the states. Justice Souter argued that the problem with the Articles of Confederation, which necessitated the Constitutional Convention, was that the federal government had too little power to bind the states, not too much.273 The fact that the Constitution gave the federal government certain limited powers to circumvent the states and regulate the people directly does not mean that the federal government is precluded from any direct regulation of the states themselves.274 Indeed, Justice Souter pointed out that the applicability of the FLSA to the states had already been settled by Garcia.275 c. Precedent As might be expected, the dissent's reading of Supreme Court precedent is also at odds with that of the majority. Justice Souter argued that, like Seminole Tribe, Alden is inconsistent with Garcia and serves to make the FLSA substantially unenforceable.276 Additionally, Justice Souter contended that the decision is inconsistent with Hilton, noting that the Court in Hilton did not even hint at any constitutional bar to the suit against South Carolina, and, further, that if such a bar had existed, the Court would not have had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case.277 As for Hans and the other cases in that line relied on by the majority, Justice Souter did not cover them directly, referring instead to his dissent in Seminole Tribe where he discussed the cases at length.278 In the Seminole Tribe dissent, Justice 270 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 800 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“The State of Maine is not sovereign with respect to the national objective of the FLSA.”). 271 See id. at 800-03. 272 See id. at 802-03. 273 See id. at 776 n.16. 274 See id. at 809 n.39. 275 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 808-09 (Justice Souter suggests that the Alden decision has vitiated Garcia).

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 533 Souter had argued that the purpose behind the Eleventh Amendment was to address the pressing concern of the states that federal jurisdiction over common law diversity suits would defeat their ability to repudiate Revolutionary War debts.279 In extending the specific diversity jurisdiction language of the Amendment to cover federal question suits as well, the Hans Court made a fundamental error which “destroyed the congruence of the judicial power under Article III with the substantive guarantees of the Constitution.”280 The error was continued and extended throughout the Hans line and, finally, in Seminole Tribe erroneously elevated from common law to constitutional status.281 Justice Souter offered evidence that the “great weight of scholarly commentary agree[d]” with this view.282 Finally, Justice Souter noted that in recognizing a principle of sovereign immunity as in Alden, the Court had abandoned the traditional belief that “where there is a right, there must be a remedy.”283 He concluded by analogizing the Court's position on state sovereign immunity to the economic substantive due process doctrine of the Lochner era284 and predicted that the Seminole Tribe/Alden doctrine would be equally fleeting.285 IV. ANALYSIS In Seminole Tribe,286 the question was the extent of Congress’s Commerce Clause powers, in relation to the question of federal jurisdiction. On the one hand, Article III grants federal courts jurisdiction over states in certain private suits and, on the other hand, the Eleventh Amendment limits this jurisdiction. In this context, the Court viewed the specific text of the Eleventh Amendment as being just one aspect of a broader principle of state sovereign immunity which is an unwritten part of the constitutional design. Although it is this broader concept of immunity rather than the precise text of the Amendment which barred the suit against the state of Florida, the 279 See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Fla., 517 U.S. 44, 112-13 (1996) (Souter, J., dissenting). 280 Id. at 119. 281 See id. at 124-27. 282 Id. at 110 n.8. 283 Alden, 527 U.S. at 811. 284 The Lochner era, named for Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905), was characterized by a laissez faire judicial philosophy under which economic rights, such as freedom to contract, were held to be constitutionally protected liberty interests. The era came to an end in the mid-1930s when the Court, under political pressure engendered by the great depression, began upholding state economic regulations. See, e.g., GEOFFREY R. STONE, LOUIS M. SEIDMAN, CASS R. SUNSTEIN & MARK V. TUSHNET, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, 829-35 (1996). 285 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 814. The resemblance of today’s state sovereign immunity to the Lochner era’s industrial due process is striking. The Court began this century by imputing immutable constitutional status to a conception of economic self-reliance that was never true to industrial life and grew insistently fictional with the years, and the Court has chosen to close the century by conferring like status on a conception of state sovereign immunity that is true neither to history nor to the structure of the Constitution. Id. 286 Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996). 31Published by EngagedScholarship@CSU, 2000 534 CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 48:503 decision was nevertheless expressly limited to federal courts and it can thus be properly seen as an extension of the Hans287 line of Eleventh Amendment cases. In Alden,288 though, federal jursidiction was not an issue. Article III and the Eleventh Amendment were not actual points of contention and there was no express constitutional jurisdiction question. The case constituted a more direct test of the extent of Congress's Article I power in connection with the Supremacy Clause and implicit structural notions of federalism. Article III and the Eleventh Amendment were implicated in the case only to the extent that they shed light on the true issue presented in Alden, which was whether there was in fact a fundamental understanding of state sovereign immunity held by the founding generation which should be held to be part of the constitutional design and, if so, what the nature of that understanding was and what the contours of the immunity should be. The Court noted both the similarity and difference between Alden and the Hans line of cases, at one point differentiating Alden state court immunity as a “separate and distinct structural principle . . . not directly related to the scope of the judicial power established by Article III,”289 but later aligning Alden with the prior cases by stating that the logic of the Hans line of cases can be extended to cover the question in Alden.290 In extending the original intent logic of Hans and Seminole Tribe to find a constitutional immunity unsupported by any actual textual provision of the Constitution (other than the broad language of the Tenth Amendment), Alden represents a clear demonstration of the power of originalism as a method of constitutional interpretation and provides an opportunity to examine originalism as applied. It is true that the Court also relied on structuralism and precedent to support its decision. These arguments, though, can be seen as secondary to, and contingent upon, the original intent rationale. For example, in rejecting the structural argument that the Supremacy Clause made the FLSA the supreme law of the land, the Court reasoned that the Act was unconstitutional, and thus outside the scope of the Supremacy Clause because it was inconsistent with the original understanding of the founders.291 Clearly the Court’s position here rests entirely upon the original intent argument. With respect to precedent, the cases relied on by the Court amount to circumstantial support at best. As the majority acknowledged, the question in Alden had never before been squarely presented.292 Original intent then, clearly serves as the primary theoretical underpinning for the decision. In his 1989 essay Originalism, the Lesser Evil,293 Justice Scalia set out both the purported advantages of originalism (as opposed to non-originalist “values” based theories of constitutional interpretation), as well as the methodology required to 287 Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1 (1890). 288 Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999). 289 Alden, 527 U.S. at 730. 290 See id. at 733. 291 See supra notes 214-16 and accompanying text. 292 Alden, 527 U.S. at 741 (“Whether Congress has authority under Article I to abrogate a State’s immunity from suit in its own courts is, then, a question of first impression”). 293 Antonin J. Scalia, Originalism, the Lesser Evil, 57 U. CIN. L. REV. 849 (1989). 32https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 535 properly apply originalism. On the first point, Justice Scalia argued that if the Constitution were assumed to have no fixed and ascertainable meaning, but were instead, an “invitation to apply current societal values,” then the legislature, not the courts, would be the appropriate body to ascertain constitutional meaning.294 For this reason, non-originalism could be said to undermine the whole doctrine of judicial review first set forth in Marbury v. Madison,295 which rests on the idea that it is the duty of the courts to ascertain the meaning of the law.296 To realize the advantages of originalism, however, the doctrine must be properly employed, and on this point Justice Scalia stated that the “greatest defect” of originalism is “the difficulty of applying it correctly.”297 It is this second concern, the proper application of originalism, that can be seen as the main point of contention between the majority and the dissent. In his essay, Justice Scalia noted that, in the case of constitutional interpretation, originalist doctrine requires consideration of an enormous body of evidence, such as the records of the state ratification debates, along with an assessment of the reliability of such evidence.298 Accordingly, the Alden Court did appear to consider a large body of material from the founding period and the majority clearly identified the specific evidence of original intent on which it relied. This consisted of “the views expressed by Hamilton, Madison, and Marshall during the ratification debates, and by Justice Iredell in his dissenting opinion in Chisholm,”299 the positions of the “only state [ratification] conventions formally to address the matter,”300 and the “events leading to the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment.”301 Additionally, the Court stated as historical fact that the states had adopted from England “the doctrine that a sovereign could not be sued without its consent” and that this doctrine was “universal in the States when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.”302 While this evidence might seem convincing when first read, all of it is contradicted by the dissent, either through equally credible but conflicting interpretations or by presentation of the dissent's own equally credible but conflicting evidence.303 Clearly the two positions can not be reconciled. However, Justice Scalia's essay offers some further guidelines which help in evaluating the opinions under originalism principles. Justice Scalia stated that proper application of originalism requires “immersing oneself in the political and intellectual atmosphere of the time,” factoring out information not known in the earlier period, and adopting the “beliefs, attitudes, philosophies, predjudices and loyalties” of the time in 294 Id. at 854. 295 5 U.S. 137 (1803). 296 See Scalia, supra note 293, at 854. 297 Scalia, supra note 293, at 856. 298 See id. at 856. 299 Alden, 527 U.S. at 727. 300 Id. at 726 (referring to New York, Virginia, Rhode Island and North Carolina). 301 Id. 302 Id. at 715-16. 303 See supra text accompanying notes 238-85. 33Published by EngagedScholarship@CSU, 2000 536 CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 48:503 question.304 In at least two areas, the thinking behind this admonition seems to favor the dissent rather than the majority opinion. First, with respect to the ratification debates, both the majority and the dissent agreed that whatever was said about state sovereign immunity was said in the context of the then pressing issue of potential suits to enforce Revolutionary War debt repayment.305 The majority presented no evidence that any of their cited speakers had considered, or intended to take a position on, immunity when federal regulation based on the Commerce Clause was at issue. The same point can be made with respect to the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment. While it is beyond doubt that the Amendment was intended to eliminate citizen-state diversity jurisdiction in federal court and the debt enforcement such jurisdiction threatened, it is something else again to read into that intent a generally held awareness or concern that some day federal laws enacted by Congress under the Commerce Clause might directly regulate the states, and an understanding that the states were to be inherently immune from any private suits that might result. By taking statements and actions out of their actual ratification era context and applying them to today’s questions, the Court seems to be violating Justice Scalia’s originalism guideline. The second area where Justice Scalia’s rule is useful is in considering the majority's contention that the original states uniformly adopted from English precedent a sovereign immunity which was indefeasible, good in both state and federal courts and on both state and federal questions. The majority supports this position with statements from Hans, Justice Iredell’s Chisholm dissent, Hamilton’s comments in The Federalist No. 81, and Blackstone's description of the sovereignty of the English Crown.306 However, none of these statements are truly “on point” and must be read in the light of subsequent events, such as Commerce Clause legislation to provide support for the majority’s position. Justice Souter, in contrast, appears to be more diligent in following Justice Scalia’s admonition to take into account the attitudes and beliefs of the time. He noted that prior to independence, the American Colonies had no sovereignty of their own,307 and that, following independence, the Constitution set out an unprecedented system of government which split “the atom of sovereignty.”308 Consequently, even assuming that the original states had adopted an English concept of sovereign immunity, there would have been no existing tradition or understanding as to how that immunity would fit into the American federal system or what the limits of the immunity would be. Against this background, Justice Souter presented evidence which tends to paint a picture of disagreement or uncertainty among the founders regarding the nature or extent of sovereign immunity rather than a well-defined and 304 Scalia, supra note 293 at 856-57. 305 Compare Alden, 527 U.S. at 715-20 and id. at 772-73 (Souter, J., dissenting). 306 See id. at 715-17. 307 See id. at 764 (Souter, J. dissenting). 308 Id. at 799-800 (quoting U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 537 widely held understanding.309 Additionally, Justice Souter noted that no state had declared in its constitution that sovereign immunity was an inalienable or natural right.310 Another of Justice Scalia's comments is telling here. After noting the difficulty of throwing off present-day prejudices and of taking on the attitudes of an earlier time, he stated that the proper application of originalism is “a task sometimes better suited to the historian than the lawyer.”311 The Court only partially heeded this advice. For example, the majority cited to the works of legal historian David Currie four times for support of its original intent arguments,312 but ignored his disclaimer that “[t]his is not to say the [Chisholm] decision was necessarily wrong. Madison, Marshall and Hamilton notwithstanding, there was no unanimity among the Framers that immunity would exist.”313 Even if these first three originalism guidelines (consider the entire historical record, take on attitudes of the period in question, and heed the historians) do not provide sufficient criteria to evaluate Alden as an application of originalism, Justice Scalia provides one other guideline which is directly relevant. He noted that one way to identify a pseudo-originalist opinion is to find that it “ignor[es] strong evidence of original intent that contradict[s] the minimal recited evidence of an original intent congenial to the court’s desires.”314 While it may not be fair to describe the majority's evidence as minimal, the amount of contradictory evidence that is ignored or dismissed is so large as to fairly raise the question whether the Court was, in fact, looking for an original intent congenial to its desires. For example, while relying on Hamilton, Madison and Marshall, the majority dismissed the views of Randolph, Wilson, and Pinckney as “scanty and equivocal evidence.”315 The pre-Chisholm decision of Maryland to submit to process in Van Stophorst v. Maryland316 and a similar decision by New York are dismissed as not “reflect[ive] of a widespread understanding.”317 The early proposals by Virginia and North Carolina to eliminate the citizen-state diversity jurisdiction language in Article III are characterized as reflecting only a generalized dissatisfaction with federal jurisdiction rather than a belief that Article III, as written, negated state immunity.318 The fact that the original constitutions of Connecticut and Rhode Island provided for 309 See supra text accompanying notes 237-83; see also, Alden, 527 U.S. at 761 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“There is no evidence . . . that any concept of inherent sovereign immunity was understood historically to apply when the sovereign sued was not the font of the law.”). 310 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 772 (Souter, J., dissenting). 311 Scalia, supra note 293, at 857. 312 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 720-24. 313 DAVID P.

The Alden majority dismissed Chisholm, though, on the grounds that the Chisholm Justices, other than Justice Iredell, had failed to address the prevailing understanding in making their decision.322 Not only might this be seen as specious reasoning (i.e., the decision was not a reflection of the original understanding because it failed to take into account the true original understanding), but, beyond that, it simply is hard to believe that the five Chisholm Justices would have failed to recognize or credit a truly fundamental understanding on the matter. Chief Justice Jay, for example, had been a co-author with Alexander Hamilton of The Federalist. He surely would have known, better than the Hans court of one hundred years later, exactly what Hamilton’s views were and whether those views were so pervasively held as to be implicit in the Constitution when it was ratified. The majority, of course, pointed to the subsequent adoption of the Eleventh Amendment as proving its argument that the Chisholm Court had failed to account for a fundamental postulate of Alden-type immunity implicit in the constitutional design. In doing so, however, the Court, as in Hans, was forced to dismiss contradictory evidence yet again, that evidence being the plain language of the Amendment itself, which addresses the diversity jurisdiction of federal courts, not a grander concept of immunity. This conflict between the Hans/Seminole Tribe/Alden view of sovereign immu- nity and the language of the Constitution is not limited to a clash with the Eleventh Amendment though. The plain text of Article III, as well as the Supremacy Clause, must be likewise supplemented, adjusted or dismissed to conform to the view of original understanding set forth in Alden. Like the Chisholm decision, the text of the Constitution appears to present evidence, too strong to ignore, that there was no fixed idea of absolute state sovereign immunity to private suits which was taken for granted during the ratification era.323 In response to this conflict with the constitutional text, the Court, throughout its opinion, warned that, in determining what the founders meant, you can not always rely on what they said. With respect to the Eleventh Amendment and Article III, the 319 See id. at 724-25. 320 See id at 721-24. 321 See supra text accompanying notes 33-45. 322 See Alden, 527 U.S. at 720. 323 Justice Souter made this same point in his Seminole Tribe dissent when in response to the majority’s charge that his textual analysis of the Eleventh Amendment was directed at a “straw man” he quipped “plain text is the Man of Steel in a confrontation with ‘background principles’ and ‘postulates which limit and control’” Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. 444 at 1152 n.13 (Souter, J., dissenting). 36https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 539 Court rejected reliance on the “mere letter”324 or “bare text”325 of the law, the “mere literal application” of the law,326 the “ahistorical literalism” of resting on the words alone,327 and “blind reliance upon the text.”328 While this kind of wholesale disparagement of textualism might be expected in an opinion based on what Justice Scalia refers to as nonoriginalism,329 it does not seem consistent with the underlying principle of originalism that the Constitution is “an enactment that has a fixed meaning . . . ascertainable to those learned in the law.”330 In the context of Alden, this continual denigration of the constitutional text has the effect of emphasizing the underlying problem - which is that if the majority’s view is correct, we must assume that the founders chose to express a fundamental understanding in language virtually certain to create conflicting interpretations.331 Of course, all the conflicting evidence notwithstanding, it might still be hypothesized that the Alden majority did in fact capture a true fundamental understanding of the founding generation in their decision. Even according this possibility a presumption of validity, though, the strong dissent of Justice Souter and the apparent discrepancies between the majority's reasoning and the tenets of originalism expounded by Justice Scalia, make it fair to consider whether there might actually be a different explanation for the decision. In his essay, Justice Scalia addressed such a possibility, noting that “the main danger in judicial interpretation of the Constitution . . . is that the judges will mistake their own predilections for the law.”332 This thought is consistent with Justice Scalia’s earlier warning that originalism can be misused to support a decision designed to set forth “an original intent congenial to the court’s desires.”333 Both comments may well shed some light on Alden, in that the Court's recent federalism decisions appear to show a definite predilection for limiting federal power and expanding “states’ rights.” In 1985, the Court decided Garcia which held that Congress could regulate the states as states under its Commerce Clause power (barring some defect in the national legislative process). The Court reasoned that the sovereignty of the states 324 Alden, 527 U.S. at 727. 325 Id. at 736. 326 Id. at 729. 327 Id. at 730. 328 Id. 329 Scalia, supra note 293, at 855. 330 Id. at 854. 331 Discussing the text of Article III in his Chisholm concurrance, Justice Wilson opined that even a “great master” of the “strictest legal language” would have been unable to more precisely or accurately provide for a diversity suit by a citizen against a state. Chisholm, 2 U.S. at 466 (Wilson, J., concurring). 332 Scalia, supra note 293, at 863. Expanding on this concept Justice Scalia warned, “It is very difficult for a person to discern a difference between those political values that he personally thinks most important, and those political values that are ‘fundamental to our society.’” Id. 333 See Scalia, supra note 293, at 852. 37Published by EngagedScholarship@CSU, 2000 540 CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 48:503 was properly protected by the prominent role in the national political process accorded them by the Constitution, not through discrete limitations on congressional power created by the judiciary. As the make-up of the Court began to change in the 1990s, however, that philosophy gave way to one which favored judicial involvement so as to further direct limitations on Congress. This trend can be seen in cases throughout the last decade. In the 1992 case of New York v. United States,334 the Court held that the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985,335 requiring States to either regulate disposal of radioactive waste produced in the state in accordance with federal guidelines or take title to the waste, exceeded the limits of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.336 The Court found that the Act, through coercion, effectively commandeered the state governments into federal regulatory service in a way which was inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment and state sovereignty.337 Five years later, similar reasoning was extended to cover individual state officers in Printz v. United States.338 The Printz Court held that provisions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act,339 requiring local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers in accordance with the federal statute’s mandate, constituted an unconstitutional attempt to conscript state officers into service as federal regulatory agents.340 The Court in Printz stated that such conscription was “fundamentally incompatible with our constitutional system of dual sovereignty.”341 In the 1995 case of United States v. Lopez,342 the Court struck down the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made firearm possession in a school zone a federal offense, on the ground that such a prohibition was not sufficiently related to interstate commerce as to be valid legislation under the Commerce Clause. The Court reasoned that any link between school zone gun possession and interstate commerce was so attenuated that the Act could not be considered a rational commerce regulation measure.343 Additionally, the Court warned of the danger of allowing the Commerce Clause become the basis for a general federal police power equivalent to the police power enjoyed by the states.344 The following year, Seminole Tribe constitutionalized state sovereign immunity from private suits for damages in 334 505 U.S. 144 (1992). 335 42 U.S.C. § 2021(b)-(j) (1994). 336 See New York, 505 U.S. at 149. 337 See id. at 175-76. 338 521 U.S. 898 (1997). 339 18 U.S.C. §§ 921-30 (1994 & Supp. 1999). 340 See Printz, 521 U.S. at 935. 341 Id. 342 514 U.S. 549 (1995). 343 See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 567. 344 See id. 38https://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/clevstlrev/vol48/iss3/6 2000] ALDEN v. MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 541 federal courts.345 Alden followed in June, 1999 and the Court’s trend can be seen in other recent immunity cases. In College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board,346 decided the same day as Alden, the Court held that Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (TCRA), which amended the Trademark Act of 1946 to authorize private suits against the states, was ineffective against state sovereign immunity.347 College Savings Bank argued that Congress enacted the TCRA pursuant to its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and thus, as per Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,348 state sovereign immunity should not serve to bar its TCRA based suit.349 The Court, however, found that the TCRA could not be seen as enforcing any provision of the Fourteenth Amendment,350 rather, being just an exercise of Article I power, the TCRA was not effective to abrogate state sovereign immunity (as per Seminole Tribe).351 Additionally, the Court held that the State of Florida had not effectively waived its sovereign immunity. In making this latter ruling, the Court expressly overruled Parden352 to the extent it had survived Welch,353 and fully repudiated the constructive waiver principle on which Parden was based.354 In the case of Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank,355 the Court held that the Patent and Plant Varieties Protection Remedy Clarification Act (Patent Remedy Act) which authorized private suits against states to remedy patent law violations could not “be sustained as legislation enacted to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.”356 Consequently, the private suits authorized by the Act were barred by state sovereign immunity. 345 See supra notes 116-123 and accompanying text. 346 527 U.S. 666 (1999). 347 See id at 690. 348 427 U.S. 445 (1976). 349 See College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 673. 350 See id. at 674. College Savings Bank (College) created and marketed a tuition savings plan. The State of Florida subsequently offered a similar plan and College filed suit claiming it was injured by misrepresentations which Florida made about its own (Florida’s) plan in violation of the TCRA. The Court held that any injury of College arising from such false advertising did not constitute a deprivation of a protected property interest within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. 351 See id. at 673. 352 Parden v. Terminal Railway of the Ala. State Docks Dep’t, 377 U.S. 184 (1964). 353 Welch v. Tex. Dep’t of Highways and Pub. Transp., 483 U.S. 468 (1987). 354 See College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 683. 355 527 U.S. 627 (1999). 356 Id. at 630. In this suit, College Savings Bank alleged violations of its patent by the State of Florida in violation of the Patent Remedy Act. Because Congress had not identified a pattern of such violations by states prior to enacting the Patent Remedy Act, the Court held that the Act was not a valid remedial or preventative measure for purposes of section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See id. at 647. 39Published by EngagedScholarship@CSU, 2000 542 CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 48:503 Most recently in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents,357 the Court held that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), while valid legislation under the Commerce Clause,358 was “not a valid exercise of Congress’s power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.”359 Consequently, as with the TCRA and the Patent Remedy Act, the provisions of the ADEA which authorized private suits against States were held to be unconstitutional violations of state sovereign immunity.360 With the exception of New York v. United States, all of these cases were decided by the same five-to-four majority that operated in Alden. In the last eight years, then, Union Gas has been overturned, Hilton has been effectively overturned, Garcia has been substantially undermined, the constructive waiver theory of Parden has been overruled, the “substantial effects” test for economic regulation under the Commerce Clause has been made more stringent (Lopez), and congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment has been repeatedly constrained. This record indicates a break with prior federalism decisions and marks a more activist course which corresponds to the establishment of the present political make-up of the Court's membership. Regardless of whether Alden is considered to be substantively good or bad for the country, when viewed in light of all the circumstances, the decision can be most realistically explained as a further step along the Court's current political path rather than as a true determination of some fundamental understanding of two hundred years ago.361 V. CONCLUSION The record of the major federalism cases of the last decade reveals a sharp ideological split within the Court on the nature and extent of state sovereign immunity as well as the broader question of the role of the judiciary in protecting or defining state sovereignty itself. As long as the present “federalist” majority is maintained or increased, the course established in the 1990s is likely to continue. If the make-up of the Court shifts in favor of the present dissenters, however, Seminole Tribe362 and Alden363 are unlikely to survive. In a strong dissenting opinion in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents,364 Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, made it clear that he rejects Seminole Tribe as valid controlling precedent.365 357 Id. at 631 (1999). 358 Id. at 643. 359 Welch, 527 U.S. at 650. 360 Id. 361 As Justice Souter pointed out, the rationale behind Alden was broad enough to encompass Seminole Tribe without any need for reliance on the Eleventh Amendment. The fact that Seminole Tribe was decided first without mention of the broader Alden Tenth Amendment rationale suggests a developing course rather than an application of pre-existing principles.

MAINE AND STATE SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 543 Even if Alden and Seminole Tribe do survive the current membership of the Court, the lack of textual support for state sovereign immunity as a constitutional principle and the flexibility of the original intent doctrine as it was applied in Alden, will continue to make the decisions subject to reversal. 41Published by EngagedScholarship@CSU, 2000 Alden v.
